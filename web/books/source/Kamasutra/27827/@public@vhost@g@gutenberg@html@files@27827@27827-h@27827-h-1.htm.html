<h3 id="pgepubid00014">ABOUT THE KINDS OF WOMEN RESORTED TO BY THE CITIZENS, AND OF FRIENDS AND MESSENGERS.</h3>
<p>When Kama is practised by men of the four castes according to the rules of the Holy Writ (<i>i.e.</i>, by lawful marriage) with virgins of their own caste, it then becomes a means of acquiring lawful progeny and good fame, and it is not also opposed to the customs of the world. On the contrary the practice of Kama with women of the higher castes, and with those previously enjoyed by others, even though they be of the same caste, is prohibited. But the practice of Kama with women of the lower castes, with women excommunicated from their own caste, with public women, and with women twice married,<a id="FNanchor_31_31"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor pginternal">[31]</a> is neither enjoined nor prohibited. The object of practising Kama with such women is pleasure only.</p>
<p>Nayikas,<a id="FNanchor_32_32"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor pginternal">[32]</a> therefore, are of three kinds, viz., maids, women twice married, and public women. Gonikaputra has expressed an opinion that there is a fourth kind of Nayika, viz., a woman who is resorted to on some special occasion even though she be previously married to another. These special occasions are when a man thinks thus:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>). This woman is self-willed, and has been previously enjoyed by many others besides myself. I may, therefore, safely resort to her as to a public woman though she belongs to a higher caste than mine, and in so doing I shall not be violating the ordinances of Dharma.</p>
</div>
<p><a id="Page_34" class="pageno" title="[34]"/></p>
<p>Or thus:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>b</i>). This is a twice-married woman and has been enjoyed by others before me, there is, therefore, no objection to my resorting to her.</p>
</div>
<p>Or thus:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>c</i>). This woman has gained the heart of her great and powerful husband, and exercises a mastery over him, who is a friend of my enemy; if, therefore, she becomes united with me, she will cause her husband to abandon my enemy.</p>
</div>
<p>Or thus:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>d</i>). This woman will turn the mind of her husband, who is very powerful, in my favour, he being at present disaffected towards me, and intent on doing me some harm.</p>
</div>
<p>Or thus:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>e</i>). By making this woman my friend I shall gain the object of some friend of mine, or shall be able to effect the ruin of some enemy, or shall accomplish some other difficult purpose.</p>
</div>
<p>Or thus:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>f</i>). By being united with this woman, I shall kill her husband, and so obtain his vast riches which I covet.</p>
</div>
<p>Or thus:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>g</i>). The union of this woman with me is not attended with any danger, and will bring me wealth, of which, on account of my poverty and inability to support myself, I am very much in need. I shall, therefore, obtain her vast riches in this way without any difficulty.</p>
</div>
<p>Or thus:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>h</i>). This woman loves me ardently, and knows all my weak points, if therefore, I am unwilling to be united with her, she will make my faults public, and thus tarnish my character and reputation. Or she will bring some gross accusation against me, of which it may be hard to clear myself, and I shall be ruined. Or perhaps she will detach from me her husband, who is powerful, and yet under her control, and will unite him to my enemy, or will herself join the latter.</p>
</div>
<p><a id="Page_35" class="pageno" title="[35]"/>Or thus:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>i</i>). The husband of this woman has violated the chastity of my wives, I shall therefore return that injury by seducing his wives.</p>
</div>
<p>Or thus:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>j</i>). By the help of this woman I shall kill an enemy of the king, who has taken shelter with her, and whom I am ordered by the king to destroy.</p>
</div>
<p>Or thus:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>k</i>). The woman whom I love is under the control of this woman. I shall, through the influence of the latter, be able to get at the former.</p>
</div>
<p>Or thus:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>l</i>). This woman will bring to me a maid, who possesses wealth and beauty, but who is hard to get at, and under the control of another.</p>
</div>
<p>Or, lastly, thus:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>m</i>). My enemy is a friend of this woman's husband, I shall therefore cause her to join him, and will thus create an enmity between her husband and him.</p>
</div>
<p>For these and similar other reasons the wives of other men may be resorted to, but it must be distinctly understood that is only allowed for special reasons, and not for mere carnal desire.</p>
<p>Charayana thinks that under these circumstances there is also a fifth kind of Nayika, viz., a woman who is kept by a minister, and who repairs to him occasionally; or a widow who accomplishes the purpose of a man with the person to whom she resorts.</p>
<p>Suvarnanabha adds that a woman who passes the life of an ascetic and in the condition of a widow may be considered as a sixth kind of Nayika.</p>
<p>Ghotakamukha says that the daughter of a public woman, and a female servant, who are still virgins, form a seventh kind of Nayika.</p>
<p>Gonardiya puts forth his doctrine that any woman born of good family, after she has come of age, is an eighth kind of Nayika.</p>
<p>But these four latter kinds of Nayikas do not differ much from the first four kinds of them, as there is no separate<a id="Page_36" class="pageno" title="[36]"/> object in resorting to them. Therefore Vatsyayana is of opinion that there are only four kinds of Nayikas, <i>i.e.</i>, the maid, the twice married woman, the public woman, and the woman resorted to for a special purpose.</p>
<p>The following women are not to be enjoyed:—</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>A leper.</li>
<li>A lunatic.</li>
<li>A woman turned out of caste.</li>
<li>A woman who reveals secrets.</li>
<li>A woman who publicly expresses desire for sexual intercourse.</li>
<li>A woman who is extremely white.</li>
<li>A woman who is extremely black.</li>
<li>A bad-smelling woman.</li>
<li>A woman who is a near relation.</li>
<li>A woman who is a female friend.</li>
<li>A woman who leads the life of an ascetic.</li>
<li>And, lastly, the wife of a relation, of a friend, of a learned Brahman, and of the king.</li>
</ul>
<p>The followers of Babhravya say that any woman who has been enjoyed by five men is a fit and proper person to be enjoyed. But Gonikaputra is of opinion that even when this is the case, the wives of a relation, of a learned Brahman and of a king should be excepted.</p>
<p>The following are the kind of friends:—</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>One who has played with you in the dust, <i>i.e.</i>, in childhood.</li>
<li>One who is bound by an obligation.</li>
<li>One who is of the same disposition and fond of the same things.</li>
<li>One who is a fellow student.</li>
<li>One who is acquainted with your secrets and faults, and whose faults and secrets are also known to you.</li>
<li>One who is a child of your nurse.</li>
<li>One who is brought up with you.</li>
<li>One who is an hereditary friend.</li>
</ul>
<p>These friends should possess the following qualities:—</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>They should tell the truth.</li>
<li>They should not be changed by time.</li>
<li>They should be favourable to your designs.</li>
<li>They should be firm.</li>
<li><a id="Page_37" class="pageno" title="[37]"/>They should be free from covetousness.</li>
<li>They should not be capable of being gained over by others.</li>
<li>They should not reveal your secrets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Charayana says that citizens form friendship with washermen, barbers, cowherds, florists, druggists, betel-leaf sellers, tavern keepers, beggars, Pithamardas, Vitas and Vidushekas, as also with the wives of all these people.</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>A messenger should possess the following qualities:—</li>
<li>Skilfulness.</li>
<li>Boldness.</li>
<li>Knowledge of the intention of men by their outward signs.</li>
<li>Absence of confusion, <i>i.e.</i>, no shyness.</li>
<li>Knowledge of the exact meaning of what others do or say.</li>
<li>Good manners.</li>
<li>Knowledge of appropriate times and places for doing different things.</li>
<li>Ingenuity in business.</li>
<li>Quick comprehension.</li>
<li>Quick application of remedies, <i>i.e.</i>, quick and ready resources.</li>
<li>And this part ends with a verse:—</li>
</ul>
<p>The man who is ingenious and wise, who is accompanied by a friend, and who knows the intentions of others, as also the proper time and place for doing everything, can gain over, very easily, even a woman who is very hard to be obtained.</p>

<p>Man is divided into three classes, viz., the hare man, the bull man, and the horse man, according to the size of his lingam.</p>
<p>Woman also, according to the depth of her yoni, is either a female deer, a mare, or a female elephant.</p>

<p><a id="Page_39" class="pageno" title="[39]"/>In these unequal unions, when the male exceeds the female in point of size, his union with a woman who is immediately next to him in size is called high union, and is of two kinds; while his union with the woman most remote from him in size is called the <a id="corr9"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn9" title="changed from 'highesf'">highest</a> union, and is of one kind only.

<p>In other words, the horse and mare, the bull and deer, form the high union, while the horse and deer form the highest union. On the female side, the elephant and bull, the mare and hare, form low unions, while the elephant and the hare make the lowest unions.</p>

</div>
<p><a id="Page_40" class="pageno" title="[40]"/>A man is called a man of small passion whose desire at the time of sexual union is not great, whose semen is scanty, and who cannot bear the warm embraces of the female.</p>
<p>Those who differ from this temperament are called men of middling passion, while those of intense passion are full of desire.</p>
<p>In the same way, women are supposed to have the three degrees of feeling as specified above.</p>
<p>Lastly, according to time there are three kinds of men and women, viz., the short-timed, the moderate-timed, and the long-timed, and of these as in the previous statements, there are nine kinds of union.</p>
<p>But on this last head there is a difference of opinion about the female, which should be stated.</p>
<p>Auddalika says, "Females do not emit as males do. The males simply remove their desire, while the females, from their consciousness of desire, feel a certain kind of pleasure, which gives them satisfaction, but it is impossible for them to tell you what kind of pleasure they feel. The fact from which this becomes evident is, that males, when engaged in coition, cease of themselves after emission, and are satisfied, but it is not so with females."</p>
<p>This opinion is, however, objected to on the grounds that if a male be a long-timed, the female loves him the more, but if he be short-timed, she is dissatisfied with him. And this circumstance, some say, would prove that the female emits also.</p>
<p>But this opinion does not hold good, for if it takes a long time to allay a woman's desire, and during this time she is enjoying great pleasure, it is quite natural then that she should wish for its continuation. And on this subject there is a verse as follows:</p>
<p>"By union with men the lust, desire, or passion of women is satisfied, and the pleasure derived from the consciousness of it is called their satisfaction."</p>
<p>The followers of Babhravya, however, say that the semen of women continues to fall from the beginning of the sexual union to its end, and it is right that it should be so, for if they had no semen there would be no embryo.</p>
<p>To this there is an objection. In the beginning of coition the passion of the woman is middling, and she cannot bear<a id="Page_41" class="pageno" title="[41]"/> the vigorous thrusts of her lover, but by degrees her passion increases until she ceases to think about her body, and then finally she wishes to stop from further coition.</p>
<p>This objection, however, does not hold good, for even in ordinary things that revolve with great force, such as a potter's wheel, or a top, we find that the motion at first is slow, but by degrees it becomes very rapid. In the same way the passion of the woman having gradually increased, she has a desire to discontinue coition, when all the semen has fallen away. And there is a verse with regard to this as follows:</p>
<p>"The fall of the semen of the man takes place only at the end of coition, while the semen of the woman falls continually, and after the semen of both has all fallen away then they wish for the discontinuance of coition."<a id="FNanchor_34_34"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor pginternal">[34]</a></p>
<p>Lastly, Vatsyayana is of opinion that the semen of the female falls in the same way as that of the male.</p>
<p>Now some may ask here: If men and women are beings of the same kind, and are engaged in bringing about the same result, why should they have different works to do.</p>
<p>Vatsya says that this is so, because the ways of working as well as the consciousness of pleasure in men and women are different. The difference in the ways of working, by which men are the actors, and women are the persons acted upon, is owing to the nature of the male and the female, otherwise the actor would be sometimes the person acted upon, and vice versâ. And from this difference in the ways of working follows the difference in the consciousness of pleasure, for a man thinks, "this woman is united with me," and a woman thinks, "I am united with this man."</p>
<p>It may be said that if <a id="corr10"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn10" title="changed from 'ihe'">the</a> ways of working in men and women are different, why should not there be a difference, even in the pleasure they feel, and which is the result of those ways.</p>
<p>But this objection is groundless, for the person acting and<a id="Page_42" class="pageno" title="[42]"/> the person acted upon being of different kinds, there is a reason for the difference in their ways of working; but there is no reason for any difference in the pleasure they feel, because they both naturally derive pleasure from the act they perform.<a id="FNanchor_35_35"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor pginternal">[35]</a></p>
<p>On this again some may say that when different persons are engaged in doing the same work, we find that they accomplish the same end or purpose: while, on the contrary, in the case of men and women we find that each of them accomplishes his or her own end separately, and this is inconsistent. But this is a mistake, for we find that sometimes two things are done at the same time, as for instance in the fighting of rams, both the rams receive the shock at the same time on their heads. Again, in throwing one wood apple against another, and also in a fight or struggle of wrestlers. If it be said that in these cases the things employed are of the same kind, it is answered that even in the case of men and women, the nature of the two persons is the same. And as the difference in their ways of working arises from the difference of their conformation only, it follows that men experience the same kind of pleasure as women do.</p>
<p>There is also a verse on this subject as follows: "Men and women being of the same nature, feel the same kind of pleasure, and therefore a man should marry such a woman as will love him ever afterwards."</p>
<p>The pleasure of men and women being thus proved to be of the same kind, it follows that in regard to time, there are nine kinds of sexual intercourse, in the same way as there are nine kinds, according to the force of passion.</p>
<p>There being thus nine kinds of union with regard to dimensions, force of passion, and time, respectively, by making<a id="Page_43" class="pageno" title="[43]"/> combinations of them, innumerable kinds of union would be produced. Therefore in each particular kind of sexual union, men should use such means as they may think suitable for the occasion.<a id="FNanchor_36_36"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor pginternal">[36]</a></p>
<p>At the first time of sexual union the passion of the male is intense, and his time is short, but in subsequent unions on the same day the reverse of this is the case. With the female, however, it is the contrary, for at the first time her passion is weak, and then her time long, but on subsequent occasions on the same day, her passion is intense and her time short, until her passion is satisfied.</p>
<p class="center c3">On the different kinds of Love.</p>
<p>Men learned in the humanities are of opinion that love is of four kinds, viz.:</p>
<ol>
<li>Love acquired by continual habit.</li>
<li>Love resulting from the imagination.</li>
<li>Love resulting from belief.</li>
<li>Love resulting from the perception of external objects.</li>
</ol>
<p>(1). Love resulting from the constant and continual performance and habit, as for instance the love of sexual intercourse, the love of hunting, the love of drinking, the love of gambling, etc., etc.</p>
<p>(2). Love which is felt for things to which we are not habituated, and which proceeds entirely from ideas, is called love resulting from imagination, as for instance, that love which some men and women and eunuchs feel for the Auparishtaka or mouth congress, and that which is felt by all for such things as embracing, kissing, etc., etc.</p>
<p>(3). The love which is mutual on both sides, and proved to be true, when each looks upon the other as his or her very own, such is called love resulting from belief by the learned.</p>
<p>(4). The love resulting from the perception of eternal<a id="Page_44" class="pageno" title="[44]"/> objects is quite evident and well-known to the world, because the pleasure which it affords is superior to the pleasure of the other kinds of love, which exists only for its sake.</p>
<p>What has been said in this chapter upon the subject of sexual union is sufficient for the learned; but for the edification of the ignorant, the same will now be treated of at length and in detail.</p>
<hr class="c1"/>
<p><a id="Page_45" class="pageno" title="[45]"/></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00019"><a id="CHAPTER_PII_II"/>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00020">OF THE EMBRACE.</h3>
<p>This part of the Kama Shastra, which treats of sexual union, is also called "Sixty-four" (Chatushshashti). Some old authors say that it is called so, because it contains sixty-four chapters. Others are of opinion that the author of this part being a person named Panchala, and the person who recited the part of the Rig Veda called Dashatapa, which contains sixty-four verses, being also called Panchala, the name "sixty-four" has been given to the part of the work in honour of the Rig Vedas. The followers of Babhravya say on the other hand that this part contains eight subjects, viz., the embrace, kissing, scratching with the nails or fingers, biting, lying down, making various sounds, playing the part of a man, and the Auparishtaka, or mouth congress. Each of these subjects being of eight kinds, and eight multiplied by eight being sixty-four, this part is therefore named "sixty-four." But Vatsyayana affirms that as this part contains also the following subjects, viz., striking, crying, the acts of a man during congress, the various kinds of congress, and other subjects, the name "sixty-four" is given to it only accidentally. As, for instance, we say this tree is "Saptaparna," or seven-leaved, this offering of rice is "Panchavarna," or five-coloured, but the tree has not seven leaves, neither has the rice <a id="corr11"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn11" title="changed from 'seven'">five</a> colours.</p>
<p>However the part sixty-four is now treated of, and the embrace, being the first subject, will now be considered.</p>
<p>Now the embrace which indicates the mutual love of a man and woman who have come together is of four kinds, viz.:</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>Touching.</li>
<li>Piercing.</li>
<li>Rubbing.</li>
<li>Pressing.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="Page_46" class="pageno" title="[46]"/>The action in each case is denoted by the meaning of the word which stands for it.</p>
<p>(1). When a man under some pretext or other goes in front or alongside of a woman and touches her body with his own, it is called the "touching embrace."</p>
<p>(2). When a woman in a lonely place bends down, as if to pick up something, and pierces, as it were, a man sitting or standing, with her breasts, and the man in return takes hold of them, it is called a "piercing embrace."</p>
<p>The above two kinds of embrace takes place only between persons who do not, as yet, speak freely with each other.</p>
<p>(3). When two lovers are walking slowly together, either in the dark, or in a place of public resort, or in a lonely place, and rub their bodies against each other, it is called a "rubbing embrace."</p>
<p>(4). When on the above occasion one of them presses the other's body forcibly against a wall or pillar, it is called a "pressing embrace."</p>
<p>These two last embraces are peculiar to those who know the intentions of each other.</p>
<p>At the time of the meeting the four following kinds of embrace are used, viz.:</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li><i>Jataveshtitaka</i>, or the twining of a creeper.</li>
<li><i>Vrikshadhirudhaka</i>, or climbing a tree.</li>
<li><i>Tila-Tandulaka</i>, or the mixture of sesamum seed with rice.</li>
<li><i>Kshiraniraka</i>, or milk and water embrace.</li>
</ul>
<p>(1). When a woman, clinging to a man as a creeper twines round a tree, bends his head down to hers with the desire of kissing him and slightly makes the sound of sut sut, embraces him, and looks lovingly towards him, it is called an embrace like the "twining of a creeper."</p>
<p>(2). When a woman, having placed one of her feet on the foot of her lover, and the other on one of his thighs, passes one of her arms round his back, and the other on his shoulders, makes slightly the sounds of singing and cooing, and wishes, as it were, to climb up him in order to have a kiss, it is called an embrace like the "climbing of a tree."</p>
<p>These two kinds of embrace take place when the lover is standing.</p>
<p>(3). When lovers lie on a bed, and embrace each other so<a id="Page_47" class="pageno" title="[47]"/> closely that the arms and thighs of the one are encircled by the arms and thighs of the other, and are, as it were, rubbing up against them, this is called an embrace like "the mixture of sesamum seed with rice."</p>
<p>(4). When a man and a woman are very much in love with each other, and not thinking of any pain or hurt, embrace each other as if they were entering into each other's bodies, either while the woman is sitting on the lap of the man or in front of him, or on a bed, then it is called an embrace like a "mixture of milk and water."</p>
<p>These two kinds of embrace take place at the time of sexual union.</p>
<p>Babhravya has thus related to us the above eight kinds of embraces.</p>
<p>Suvarnanabha, moreover, gives us four ways of embracing simple members of the body, which are:</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>The embrace of the thighs.</li>
<li>The embrace of the jaghana, <i>i.e.</i>, the part of the body from the navel downwards to the thighs.</li>
<li>The embrace of the breasts.</li>
<li>The embrace of the forehead.</li>
</ul>
<p>(1). When one of two lovers presses forcibly one or both of the thighs of the other between his or her own, it is called the "embrace of thighs."</p>
<p>(2). When a man presses the jaghana or middle part of the woman's body against his own, and mounts upon her to practise, either scratching with the nail or finger, or biting, or striking, or kissing, the hair of the woman being loose and flowing, it is called the "embrace of the jaghana."</p>
<p>(3). When a man places his breast between the breasts of a woman, and presses her with it, it is called the "embrace of the breasts."</p>
<p>(4). When either of the lovers touches the mouth, the eyes and the forehead of the other with his or her own, it is called the "embrace of the forehead."</p>
<p>Some say that even shampooing is a kind of embrace, because there is a touching of bodies in it. But Vatsyayana thinks that shampooing is performed at a different time, and for a different purpose, and it is also of a different character, it cannot be said to be included in the embrace.</p>
<p><a id="Page_48" class="pageno" title="[48]"/>There are also some verses on the subject as follows: "The whole subject of embracing is of such a nature that men who ask questions about it, or who hear about it, or who talk about it, acquire thereby a desire for enjoyment. Even those embraces that are not mentioned in the Kama Shastra should be practised at the time of sexual enjoyment, if they are in any way conducive to the increase of love or passion. The rules of the Shastra apply so long as the passion of man is middling, but when the wheel of love is once set in motion, there is then no Shastra and no order."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00021"><a id="CHAPTER_PII_III"/>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00022">ON KISSING.</h3>
<p>It is said by some that there is no fixed time or order between the embrace, the kiss, and the pressing or scratching with the nails or fingers, but that all these things should be done generally before sexual union takes place, while striking and making the various sounds generally takes place at the time of the union. Vatsyayana, however, thinks that anything may take place at any time, for love does not care for time or order.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the first congress, kissing and the other things mentioned above should be done moderately, they should not be continued for a long time, and should be done alternately. On subsequent occasions, however, the reverse of all this may take place, and moderation will not be necessary, they may continue for a long time, and for the purpose of kindling love, they may be all done at the same time.</p>
<p>The following are the places for kissing, viz., the forehead, the eyes, the cheeks, the throat, the bosom, the breasts, the lips, and the interior of the mouth. Moreover, the people of the Lat country kiss also on the following places, viz., the joints of the thighs, the arms, and the navel. But Vatsyayana thinks that though kissing is practised by these people in the above places on account of the intensity of their love, and the customs of their country, it is not fit to be practised by all.</p>
<p>Now in a case of a young girl there are three sort of kisses, viz.:</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>The nominal kiss.</li>
<li>The throbbing kiss.</li>
<li>The touching kiss.</li>
</ul>
<p>(1). When a girl only touches the mouth of her lover with her own, but does not herself do anything, it is called the "nominal kiss."</p>
<p>(2). When a girl, setting aside her bashfulness a little, wishes to touch the lip that is pressed into her mouth, and<a id="Page_50" class="pageno" title="[50]"/> with that object moves her lower lip, but not the upper one, it is called the "throbbing kiss."</p>
<p>(3). When a girl touches her lover's lip with her tongue, and having shut her eyes, places her hands on those of her lover, it is called the "touching kiss."</p>
<p>Other authors describe four other kinds of kisses, viz.:</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>The straight kiss.</li>
<li>The bent kiss.</li>
<li>The turned kiss.</li>
<li>The pressed kiss.</li>
</ul>
<p>(1). When the lips of two lovers are brought into direct contact with each other, it is called a "straight kiss."</p>
<p>(2). When the heads of two lovers are bent towards each other, and when so bent kissing takes place, it is called a "bent kiss."</p>
<p>(3). When one of them turns up the face of the other by holding the head and chin, and then kissing, it is called a "turned kiss."</p>
<p>(4). Lastly, when the lower lip is pressed with much force, it is called a "pressed kiss."</p>
<p>There is also a fifth kind of kiss called the "greatly pressed kiss," which is effected by taking hold of the lower lip between two fingers, and then after touching it with the tongue, pressing it with great force with the lip.</p>
<p>As regards kissing, a wager may be laid as to which will get hold of the lips of the other first. If the woman loses, she should pretend to cry, should keep her lover off by shaking her hands, and turn away from him and dispute with him, saying "let another wager be laid." If she loses this a second time, she should appear doubly distressed, and when her lover is off his guard or asleep, she should get hold of his lower lip, and hold it in her teeth, so that it should not slip away, and then she should laugh, make a loud noise, deride him, dance about, and say whatever she likes in a joking way, moving her eyebrows, and rolling her eyes. Such are the wagers and quarrels as far as kissing is concerned, but the same may be applied with regard to the pressing or scratching with the nails and fingers, biting and striking. All these, however, are only peculiar to men and women of intense passion.</p>
<p>When a man kisses the upper lip of a woman, while she in return kisses his lower lip, it is called the "kiss of the upper lip."</p>
<p>When one of them takes both the lips of the other between<a id="Page_51" class="pageno" title="[51]"/> his or her own, it is called "a clasping kiss." A woman, however, only takes this kind of kiss from a man who has no moustache. And on the occasion of this kiss, if one of them touches the teeth, the tongue, and the palate of the other, with his or her tongue, it is called the "fighting of the tongue." In the same way, the pressing of the teeth of the one against the mouth of the other is to be practised.</p>
<p>Kissing is of four kinds, viz., moderate, contracted, pressed, and soft, according to the different parts of the body which are kissed, for different kinds of kisses are appropriate for different parts of the body.</p>
<p>When a woman looks at the face of her lover while he is asleep, and kisses it to show her intention or desire, <a id="corr12"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn12" title="changed from 'is'">it</a> is called a "kiss that kindles love."</p>
<p>When a woman kisses her lover while he is engaged in business, or while he is quarrelling with her, or while he is looking at something else, so that his mind may be turned away, it is called a "kiss that turns away."</p>
<p>When a lover coming home late at night kisses his beloved, who is asleep or in bed, in order to show her his desire, it is called a "kiss that awakens." On such an occasion the woman may pretend to be asleep at the time of her lover's arrival, so that she may know his intention and obtain respect from him.</p>
<p>When a person kisses the reflection of the person he loves in a mirror, in water, or on a wall, it is called a "kiss showing the intention."</p>
<p>When a person kisses a child sitting on his lap, or a picture, or an image, or figure, in the presence of the person beloved by him, it is called a "transferred kiss."</p>
<p>When at night at a theatre, or in an assembly of caste men, a man coming up to a woman kisses a finger of her hand if she be standing, or a toe of her foot if she be sitting, or when a woman is shampooing her lover's body, places her face on his thigh (as if she was sleepy) so as to inflame his passion, and kisses his thigh or great toe, it is called a "demonstrative kiss."</p>
<p>There is also a verse on the subject as follows:—</p>
<p>"Whatever things may be done by one of the lovers to the other, the same should be returned by the other, <i>i.e.</i>, if the woman kisses him he should kiss her in return, if she strikes him he should also strike her in return."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00023"><a id="CHAPTER_PII_IV"/>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00024">ON PRESSING, OR MARKING, OR SCRATCHING WITH THE NAILS.</h3>
<p>When love becomes intense, pressing with the nails or scratching the body with them is practised, and it is done on the following occasions: On the first visit; at the time of setting out on a journey; on the return from a journey; at the time when an angry lover is reconciled; and lastly when the woman is intoxicated.</p>
<p>But pressing with the nails is not an usual thing except with those who are intensely passionate, <i>i.e.</i>, full of passion. It is employed together with biting, by those to whom the practice is agreeable.</p>
<p>Pressing with the nails is of the eight following kinds, according to the forms of the marks which are produced, viz.:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sounding.</li>
<li>Half moon.</li>
<li>A circle.</li>
<li>A line.</li>
<li>A tiger's nail or claw.</li>
<li>A peacock's foot.</li>
<li>The jump of a hare.</li>
<li>The leaf of a blue lotus.</li>
</ol>
<p>The places that are to be pressed with the nails are as follows: the arm pit, the throat, the breasts, the lips, the jaghana, or middle parts of the body, and the thighs. But Suvarnanabha is of opinion that when the impetuosity of passion is <a id="corr13"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn13" title="changed from 'e ces ve'">excessive</a>, then the places need not be considered.</p>
<p>The qualities of good nails are that they should be bright, well set, clean, entire, convex, soft, and glossy in appearance. Nails are of three kinds according to their size, viz.:</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>Small.</li>
<li><a id="corr14"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn14" title="changed from 'Middllng">Middling</a>.</li>
<li>Large.</li>
</ul>
<p>Large nails, which give grace to the hands, and attract the<a id="Page_53" class="pageno" title="[53]"/> hearts of women from their appearance, are possessed by the Bengalees.</p>
<p>Small nails, which can be used in various ways, and are to be applied only with the object of giving pleasure, are possessed by the people of the southern districts.</p>
<p>Middling nails, which contain the properties of both the above kinds, belong to the people of the Maharashtra.</p>
<p>(1). When a person presses the chin, the breasts, the lower lip, or the jaghana of another so softly that no scratch or mark is left, but only the hair on the body becomes erect from the touch of the nails, and the nails themselves make a sound, it is called a "sounding or pressing with the nails."</p>
<p>This pressing is used in the case of a young girl when her lover shampoos her, scratches her head, and wants to trouble or frighten her.</p>
<p>(2). The curved mark with the nails, which is impressed on the neck and the breasts, <a id="corr15"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn15" title="changed from 'it is'">is</a> called the "half moon."</p>
<p>(3). When the half moons are impressed opposite to each other, it is called a "circle." This mark with the nails is generally made on the navel, the small cavities about the buttocks, and on the joints of the thigh.</p>
<p>(4). A mark in the form of a small line, and which can be made on any part of the body, is called a "line."</p>
<p>(5). This same line, when it is curved, and made on the breast, is called a "tiger's nail."</p>
<p>(6). When a curved mark is made on the breast by means of the five nails, it is called a "peacock's foot." This mark is made with the object of being praised, for it requires a great deal of skill to make it properly.</p>
<p>(7). When five marks with the nails are made close to one another near the nipple of the breast, it is called "the jump of a hare."</p>
<p>(8). A mark made on the breast or on the hips in the form of a leaf of the blue lotus, is called the "leaf of a blue lotus."</p>
<p>When a person is going on a journey, and makes a mark on the thighs, or on the breast, it is called a "token of remembrance." On such an occasion three or four lines are impressed close to one another with the nails.</p>
<p>Here ends the marking with the nails. Marks of other kinds than the above may also be made with the nails, for the<a id="Page_54" class="pageno" title="[54]"/> ancient authors say, that as there are innumerable degrees of skill among men (the practice of this art being known to all), so there are innumerable ways of making these marks. And as pressing or marking with the nails is independent of love, no one can say with certainty how many different kinds of marks with the nails do actually exist. The reason of this is, Vatsyayana says, that as variety is necessary in love, so love is to be produced by means of variety. It is on this account that courtezans, who are well acquainted with various ways and means, become so desirable, for if variety is sought in all the arts and amusements, such as archery and others, how much more should it be sought after in the present case.</p>
<p>The marks of the nails should not be made on married women, but particular kinds of marks may be made on their private parts for the remembrance and increase of love.</p>
<p>There are also some verses on the subject, as follows:</p>
<p>"The love of a woman who sees the marks of nails on the private parts of her body, even though they are old and almost worn out, becomes again fresh and new. If there be no marks of nails to remind a person of the passages of love, then love is lessened in the same way as when no union takes place for a long time."</p>
<p>Even when a stranger sees at a distance a young woman with the marks of nails on her breast,<a id="FNanchor_37_37"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor pginternal">[37]</a> he is filled with love and respect for her.</p>
<p>A man, also, who carries the marks of nails and teeth on some parts of his body, influences the mind of a woman, even though it be ever so firm. In short, nothing tends to increase love so much as the effects of marking with the nails, and biting.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00026">ON BITING, AND THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED WITH REGARD TO WOMEN OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.</h3>
<p>All the places that can be kissed, are also the places that can be bitten, except the upper lip, the interior of the mouth, and the eyes.</p>
<p>The qualities of good teeth are as follows: They should be equal, possessed of a pleasing brightness, capable of being coloured, of proper proportions, unbroken, and with sharp ends.</p>
<p>The defects of teeth on the other hand are, that they are blunt, protruding from the gums, rough, soft, large, and loosely set.</p>
<p>The following are the different kinds of biting, viz.:</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>The hidden bite.</li>
<li>The swollen bite.</li>
<li>The point.</li>
<li>The line of points.</li>
<li>The coral and the jewel.</li>
<li>The line of jewels.</li>
<li>The broken cloud.</li>
<li>The biting of the boar.</li>
</ul>
<p>(1). The biting which is shown only by the excessive redness of the skin that is bitten, is called the "hidden bite."</p>
<p>(2). When the skin is pressed down on both sides, it is called the "swollen bite."</p>
<p>(3). When a small portion of the skin is bitten with two teeth only, it is called the "point."</p>
<p>(4). When such small portions of the skin are bitten with all the teeth, it is called the "line of points."</p>
<p>(5). The biting which is done by bringing together the<a id="Page_56" class="pageno" title="[56]"/> teeth and the lips, is called the "coral and the jewel." The lip is the coral, and the teeth the jewel.</p>
<p>(6). When biting is done with all the teeth, it is called the "line of jewels."</p>
<p>(7). The biting which consists of unequal risings in a circle, and which comes from the space between the teeth, is called the "broken cloud." This is impressed on the breasts.</p>
<p>(8). The biting which consists of many broad rows of marks near to one another, and with red intervals, is called the "biting of a boar." This is impressed on the breasts and the shoulders; and these two last modes of biting are peculiar to persons of intense passion.</p>
<p>The lower lip is the place on which the "hidden bite," the "swollen bite," and the "point" are made; again the "swollen bite," and the "coral and the jewel" bite are done on the cheek. Kissing, pressing with the nails, and biting are the ornaments of the left cheek, and when the word cheek is used it is to be understood as the left cheek.</p>
<p>Both the "line of points" and the "line of jewels" are to be impressed on the throat, the arm pit, and the joints of the thighs; but the "line of points" alone is to be impressed on the forehead and the thighs.</p>
<p>The marking with the nails, and the biting of the following things, viz., an ornament of the forehead, an ear ornament, a bunch of flowers, a betel leaf, or a tamala leaf, which are worn by, or belong to the woman that is beloved, are signs of the desire of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Here end the different kinds of biting.</p>
<hr class="c10"/>
<p>In the affairs of love a man should do such things as are agreeable to the women of different countries.</p>
<p>The women of the central countries (<i>i.e.</i>, between the Ganges and the Jumna) are noble in their character, not accustomed to disgraceful practices, and dislike pressing the nails and biting.</p>
<p>The women of the Balhika country are gained over by striking.</p>
<p>The women of Avantika are fond of foul pleasures, and have not good manners.</p>
<p><a id="Page_57" class="pageno" title="[57]"/>The women of the Maharashtra are fond of practising the sixty-four arts, they utter low and harsh words, and like to be spoken to in the same way, and have an impetuous desire of enjoyment.</p>
<p>The women of Pataliputra (<i>i.e.</i>, the modern Patna) are of the same nature as the women of the Maharashtra, but show their likings only in secret.</p>
<p>The women of the Dravida country, though they are rubbed and pressed about at the time of sexual enjoyment, have a slow fall of semen, that is they are very slow in the act of coition.</p>
<p>The women of Vanavasi are moderately passionate, they go through every kind of enjoyment, cover their bodies, and abuse those who utter low, mean and harsh words.</p>
<p>The women of Avanti hate kissing, marking with the nails, and biting, but they have a fondness for various kinds of sexual union.</p>
<p>The women of Malwa like embracing and kissing, but not wounding, and they are gained over by striking.</p>
<p>The women of Abhira, and those of the country about the Indus and five rivers (<i>i.e.</i>, the Punjab), are gained over by the Auparishtaka or mouth congress.</p>
<p>The women of Aparatika are full of passion, and make slowly the sound "Sit."</p>
<p>The women of the Lat country have even more impetuous desire, and also make the sound "Sit."</p>
<p>The women of the Stri Rajya, and of Koshola (Oude), are full of impetuous desire, their semen falls in large quantities, and they are fond of taking medicine to make it do so.</p>
<p>The women of the Audhra country have tender bodies, they are fond of enjoyment, and have a liking for voluptuous pleasures.</p>
<p>The women of Ganda have tender bodies, and speak sweetly.</p>
<p>Now Suvarnanabha is of opinion that that which is agreeable to the nature of a particular person, is of more consequence than that which is agreeable to a whole nation, and that therefore the peculiarities of the country should not be observed in such cases. The various pleasures, the dress, and the sports of one country are in time borrowed by another, and in such a case these things must be considered as belonging originally to that country.</p>
<p><a id="Page_58" class="pageno" title="[58]"/>Among the things mentioned above, viz., embracing, kissing, etc., those which increase passion should be done first, and those which are only for amusement or variety should be done afterwards.</p>
<p>There are also some verses on this subject as follows:</p>
<p>"When a man bites a woman forcibly, she should angrily do the same to him with double force. Thus a 'point' should be returned with a 'line of points,' and a 'line of points' with a 'broken cloud,' and if she be excessively chafed, she should at once begin a love quarrel with him. At such a time she should take hold of her lover by the hair, and bend his head down, and kiss his lower lip, and then, being intoxicated with love, she should shut her eyes and bite him in various places. Even by day, and in a place of public resort, when her lover shows her any mark that she may have inflicted on his body, she should smile at the sight of it, and turning her face as if she were going to chide him, she should show him with an angry look the marks on her own body that have been made by him. Thus if men and women act according to each other's liking, their love for each other will not be lessened even in one hundred years."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00027"><a id="CHAPTER_PII_VI"/>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00028">OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF LYING DOWN, AND VARIOUS KINDS OF CONGRESS.</h3>
<p>On the occasion of a "high congress" the Mrigi (Deer) woman should lie down in such a way as to widen her yoni, while in a "low congress" the Hastini (Elephant) woman should lie down so as to contract hers. But in an "equal congress" they should lie down in the natural position. What is said above concerning the Mrigi and the Hastini applies also to the Vadawa (Mare) woman. In a "low congress" the women should particularly make use of medicine, to cause her desires to be satisfied quickly.</p>
<p>The Deer-woman has the following three ways of lying down.</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>The widely opened position.</li>
<li>The yawning position.</li>
<li>The position of the wife of Indra.</li>
</ul>
<p>(1). When she lowers her head and raises her middle parts, it is called the "widely opened position." At such a time the man should apply some unguent, so as to make the entrance easy.</p>
<p>(2). When she raises her thighs and keeps them wide apart and engages in congress, it is called the "yawning position."</p>
<p>(3). When she places her thighs with her legs doubled on them upon her sides, and thus engages in congress, it is called the position of Indrani, and this is learnt only by practice. The position is also useful in the case of the "highest congress."</p>
<p>The "clasping position" is used in "low congress," and in the "lowest congress," together with the "pressing position," the "twining position", and the "mare's position."</p>
<p>When the legs of both the male and the female are<a id="Page_60" class="pageno" title="[60]"/> stretched straight out over each other, it is called the "clasping position." It is of two kinds, the side position and the supine position, according to the way in which they lie down. In the side position the male should invariably lie on his left side, and cause the woman to lie on her right side, and this rule is to be observed in lying down with all kinds of women.</p>
<p>When, after congress has begun in the clasping position, the woman presses her lover with her thighs, it is called the "pressing position."</p>
<p>When the woman places one of her thighs across the thigh of her lover, it is called the "twining position."</p>
<p>When a woman forcibly holds in her yoni the lingam after it is in, it is called the "mare's position." This is learnt by practice only, and is chiefly found among the women of the Andra country.</p>
<p>The above are the different ways of lying down, mentioned by Babhravya; Suvarnanabha, however, gives the following in addition.</p>
<p>When the female raises both of her thighs straight up, it is called the "rising position."</p>
<p>When she raises both of her legs, and places them on her lover's shoulders, it is called the "yawning position."</p>
<p>When the legs are contracted, and thus held by the lover before his bosom, it is called the "pressed position."</p>
<p>When only one of her legs is stretched out, it is called the "half pressed position."</p>
<p>When the woman places one of her legs on her lover's shoulder, and stretches the other out, and then places the latter on his shoulder, and stretches out the other, and continues to do so alternately, it is called the "splitting of a bamboo."</p>
<p>When one of her legs is placed on the head, and the other is stretched out, it is called the "fixing of a nail." This is learnt by practice only.</p>
<p>When both the legs of the woman are contracted, and placed on her stomach, it is called the "crab's position."</p>
<p>When the thighs are raised and placed one upon the other, it is called the "packed position."</p>
<p>When the shanks are placed one upon the other, it is called the "lotus-like position."</p>
<p><a id="Page_61" class="pageno" title="[61]"/>When a man, during congress, turns round, and enjoys the woman without leaving her, while she embraces him round the back all the time, it is called the "turning position," and is learnt only by practice.</p>
<p>Thus says Suvarnanabha, these different ways of lying down, sitting, and standing should be practised in water, because it is easy to do so therein. But Vatsyayana is of opinion that congress in water is improper, because it is prohibited by the religious law.</p>
<p>When a man and a woman support themselves on each other's bodies, or on a wall, or pillar, and thus while standing engage in congress, it is called the "supported congress."</p>
<p>When a man supports himself against a wall, and the woman, sitting on his hands joined together and held underneath her, throws her arms round his neck, and putting her thighs alongside his waist, moves herself by her feet, which are touching the wall against which the man is leaning, it is called the "suspended congress."</p>
<p>When a woman stands on her hands and feet like a quadruped, and her lover mounts her like a bull, it is called the "congress of a cow." At this time everything that is ordinarily done on the bosom should be done on the back.</p>
<p>In the same way can be carried on the congress of a dog, the congress of a goat, the congress of a deer, the forcible mounting of an ass, the congress of a cat, the jump of a tiger, the pressing of an elephant, the rubbing of a boar, and the mounting of a horse. And in all these cases the characteristics of these different animals should be manifested by acting like them.</p>
<p>When a man enjoys two women at the same time, both of whom love him equally, it is called the "united congress."</p>
<p>When a man enjoys many women altogether, it is called the "congress of a herd of cows."</p>
<p>The following kinds of congress, viz., sporting in water, or the congress of an elephant with many female elephants, which is said to take place only in the water, the congress of a collection of goats, the congress of a collection of deer, take place in imitation of these animals.</p>
<p>In Gramaneri many young men enjoy a woman that may be married to one of them, either one after the other, or at<a id="Page_62" class="pageno" title="[62]"/> the same time. Thus one of them holds her, another enjoys her, a third uses her mouth, a fourth holds her middle part, and in this way they go on enjoying her several parts alternately.</p>
<p>The same things can be done when several men are sitting in company with one courtesan, or when one courtesan is alone with many men. In the same way this can be done by the women of the King's harem when they accidentally get hold of a man.</p>
<p>The people in the Southern countries have also a congress in the anus, that is called the "lower congress."</p>
<p>Thus ends the various kinds of congress. There are also two verses on the subject as follows.</p>
<p>"An ingenious person should multiply the kinds of congress after the fashion of the different kinds of beasts and of birds. For these different kinds of congress, performed according to the usage of each country, and the liking of each individual, generate love, friendship, and respect in the hearts of women."</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00030">OF THE VARIOUS MODES OF STRIKING, AND OF THE SOUNDS APPROPRIATE TO THEM.</h3>
<p>Sexual intercourse can be compared to a quarrel, on account of the contrarieties of love and its tendency to dispute. The place of striking with passion is the body, and on the body the special places are:</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>The shoulders.</li>
<li>The head.</li>
<li>The space between the breasts.</li>
<li>The back.</li>
<li>The jaghana, or middle part of the body.</li>
<li>The sides.</li>
</ul>
<p>Striking is of four kinds, viz.:</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>Striking with the back of the hand.</li>
<li>Striking with the fingers a little contracted.</li>
<li>Striking with the fist.</li>
<li>Striking with the open palm of the hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>On account of its causing pain, striking gives rise to the hissing sound, which is of various kinds, and to the eight kinds of crying, viz.:</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>The sound Hin.</li>
<li>The thundering sound.</li>
<li>The cooing sound..</li>
<li>The weeping sound.</li>
<li>The sound Phut.</li>
<li>The sound Phât.</li>
<li>The sound Sût.</li>
<li>The sound Plât.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these, there are also words having a meaning, such as "mother," and those that are expressive of prohibition, sufficiency, desire of liberation, pain or praise, and to which may be added sounds like those of the dove, the cuckoo, the green pigeon, the parrot, the bee, the sparrow, the flamingo, the duck, and the quail, which are all occasionally made use of.</p>
<p><a id="Page_64" class="pageno" title="[64]"/>Blows with the fist should be given on the back of the woman, while she is sitting on the lap of the man, and she should give blows in return, abusing the man as if she were angry, and making the cooing and the weeping sounds. While the woman is engaged in congress the space between the breasts should be struck with the back of the hand, slowly at first, and then proportionately to the increasing excitement, until the end.</p>
<p>At this time the sounds Hin and others may be made, alternately or optionally, according to habit. When the man, making the sound Phât, strikes the woman on the head, with the fingers of his hand a little contracted, it is called Prasritaka, which means striking with the fingers of the hand a little contracted. In this case the appropriate sounds are the cooing sound, the sound Phât, and the sound Phut in the interior of the mouth, and at the end of congress the sighing and weeping sounds. The sound Phât is an imitation of the sound of a bamboo being split, while the sound Phut is like the sound made by something falling into water. At all times when kissing and such like things are begun, the woman should give a reply with a hissing sound. During the excitement when the woman is not accustomed to striking, she continually utters words expressive of prohibition, sufficiently, or desire of liberation, as well as the words "father," "mother," intermingled with the sighing, weeping and thundering sounds.<a id="FNanchor_38_38"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor pginternal">[38]</a> Towards the conclusion of the congress, the breasts, the jaghana, and the sides of the woman should be pressed with the open palms of the hand, with some force, until the end of it, and then sounds like those of the quail, or the goose should be made.</p>
<p>There are also two verses on the subject as follows:</p>
<p>"The characteristics of manhood are said to consist of roughness and impetuosity, while weakness, tenderness, sensibility, and an inclination to turn away from unpleasant things are the distinguishing marks of womanhood. The excitement of passion, and peculiarities of habit may sometimes cause contrary<a id="Page_65" class="pageno" title="[65]"/> results to appear, but these do not last long, and in the end the natural state is resumed."</p>
<p>The wedge on the bosom, the scissors on the head, the piercing instrument on the cheeks, and the pinchers on the breasts and sides, may also be taken into consideration with the other four modes of striking, and thus give eight ways altogether. But these four ways of striking with instruments are peculiar to the people of the southern countries, and the marks caused by them are seen on the breasts of their women. They are local peculiarities, but Vatsyayana is of opinion that the practice of them is painful, barbarous, and base, and quite unworthy of imitation.</p>
<p>In the same way anything that is a local peculiarity should not always be adopted elsewhere, and even in the place where the practice is prevalent, excess of it should always be avoided. Instances of the dangerous use of them may be given as follows. The King of the Panchalas killed the courtezan Madhavasena by means of the wedge during congress. King Shatakarni Shatavahana of the Kuntalas deprived his great Queen Malayavati of her life by a pair of scissors, and Naradeva, whose hand was deformed, blinded a dancing girl by directing a piercing instrument in a wrong way.</p>
<p>There are also two verses on the subject as follows:</p>
<p>"About these things there cannot be either enumeration or any definite rule. Congress having once commenced, passion alone gives birth to all the acts of the parties."</p>
<p>Such passionate actions and amorous gesticulations or movements, which arise on the spur of the moment, and during sexual intercourse, cannot be defined, and are as irregular as dreams. A horse having once attained the fifth degree of motion goes on with blind speed, regardless of pits, ditches, and posts in his way; and in the same manner a loving pair become blind with passion in the heat of congress, and go on with great impetuosity, paying not the least regard to excess. For this reason one who is well acquainted with the science of love, and knowing his own strength, as also the tenderness, impetuosity, and strength of the young woman, should act accordingly. The various modes of enjoyment are not for all times or for all persons, but they should only be used at the proper time, and in the proper countries and places.</p>
