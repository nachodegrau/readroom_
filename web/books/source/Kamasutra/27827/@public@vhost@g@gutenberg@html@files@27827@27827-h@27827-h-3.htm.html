<h3 id="pgepubid00054">ON THE CONDUCT OF THE ELDER WIFE TOWARDS THE OTHER WIVES OF HER HUSBAND, AND ON THAT OF A YOUNGER WIFE TOWARDS THE ELDER ONES. ALSO ON THE CONDUCT OF A VIRGIN WIDOW RE-MARRIED; OF A WIFE DISLIKED BY HER HUSBAND; OF THE WOMEN IN THE KING'S HAREM; AND LASTLY ON THE CONDUCT OF A HUSBAND TOWARDS MANY WIVES.</h3>
<p>The causes of re-marrying during the lifetime of the wife are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The folly or ill temper of the wife.</li>
<li>Her husband's dislike to her.</li>
<li>The want of offspring.</li>
<li>The continual birth of daughters.</li>
<li>The incontinence of the husband.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the very beginning the wife should endeavour to attract the heart of her husband, by showing to him continually her devotion, her good temper, and her wisdom. If however she bears him no children, she should herself tell her husband to marry another woman. And when the second wife is married, and brought to the house, the first wife should give her a position superior to her own, and look upon her as a sister. In the morning the elder wife should forcibly make the younger one decorate herself in the presence of their husband, and should not mind all the husband's favour being given to her. If the younger wife does anything to displease her husband the elder one should not neglect her, but should always be ready to give her most careful advice, and should teach her to do various things in the presence of her husband. Her children she should treat as her own, her attendants she should look upon with more regard, even than on her own servants,<a id="Page_103" class="pageno" title="[103]"/> her friends she should cherish with love and kindness, and her relations with great honour.</p>
<p>When there are many other wives besides herself, the elder wife should associate with the one who is immediately next to her in rank and age, and should instigate the wife who has recently enjoyed her husband's favour to quarrel with the present favourite. After this she should sympathize with the former, and having collected all the other wives together, should get them to denounce the favourite as a scheming and wicked woman, without however committing herself in any way. If the favourite wife happens to quarrel with the husband, then the elder wife should take her part and give her false encouragement, and thus cause the quarrel to be increased. If there be only a little quarrel between the two, the elder wife should do all she can to work it up into a large quarrel. But if after all this she finds the husband still continues to love his favourite wife she should then change her tactics, and endeavour to bring about a conciliation between them, so as to avoid her husband's displeasure.</p>
<p>Thus ends the conduct of the elder wife.</p>
<p>The younger wife should regard the elder wife of her husband as her mother, and should not give anything away, even to her own relations, without her knowledge. She should tell her everything about herself, and not approach her husband without her permission. Whatever is told to her by the elder wife she should not reveal to others, and she should take care of the children of the senior even more than of her own. When alone with her husband she should serve him well, but should not tell him of the pain she suffers from the existence of a rival wife. She may also obtain secretly from her husband some marks of his particular regard for her, and may tell him that she lives only for him, and for the regard that he has for her. She should never reveal her love for her husband, nor her husband's love for her to any person, either in pride or in anger, for a wife that reveals the secrets of her husband is despised by him. As for seeking to obtain the regard of her husband, Gonardiya says, that it should always be done in private, for fear of the elder wife. If the elder wife be disliked by her husband, or be childless, she should sympathize<a id="Page_104" class="pageno" title="[104]"/> with her, and should ask her husband to do the same, but should surpass her in leading the life of a chaste woman.</p>
<p>Thus ends the conduct of the younger wife towards the elder.</p>
<p>A widow in poor circumstances, or of a weak nature, and who allies herself again to a man, is called a widow re-married.</p>
<p>The followers of Babhravya <a id="corr24"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn24" title="changed from 'says'">say</a> that a virgin widow should not marry a person whom she may be obliged to leave on account of his bad character, or of his being destitute of the excellent qualities of a man, she thus being obliged to have recourse to another person. Gonardya is of opinion that as the cause of a widow's marrying again is her desire for happiness, and as happiness is secured by the possession of excellent qualities in her husband, joined to love of enjoyment, it is better therefore to secure a person endowed with such qualities in the first instance. Vatsyayana however thinks that a widow may marry any person that she likes, and that she thinks will suit her.</p>
<p>At the time of her marriage the widow should obtain from her husband the money to pay the cost of drinking parties, and picnics with her relations, and of giving them and her friends kindly gifts and presents; or she may do these things at her own cost if she likes. In the same way she may wear either her husband's ornaments or her own. As to the presents of affection mutually exchanged between the husband and herself there is no fixed rule about them. If she leaves her husband after marriage of her own accord, she should restore to him whatever he may have given her, with the exception of the mutual presents. If however she is driven out of the house by her husband she should not return anything to him.</p>
<p>After her marriage she should live in the house of her husband like one of the chief members of the family, but should treat the other ladies of the family with kindness, the servants with generosity, and all the friends of the house with familiarity and good temper. She should show that she is better acquainted with the sixty-four arts than the other ladies of the house, and in any quarrels with her husband she should not rebuke him severely, but in private do everything that he wishes, and make use of the sixty-four ways of enjoyment. She should be obliging to the other wives of her husband, and<a id="Page_105" class="pageno" title="[105]"/> to their children she should give presents, behave as their mistress, and make ornaments and play things for their use. In the friends and servants of her husband she should confide more than in his other wives, and finally she should have a liking for drinking parties, going to picnics, attending fairs and festivals, and for carrying out all kinds of games and amusements.</p>
<p>Thus ends the conduct of a virgin widow re-married.</p>
<p>A woman who is disliked by her husband, and annoyed and distressed by his other wives, should associate with the wife who is liked most by her husband, and who serves him more than the others, and should teach her all the arts with which she is acquainted. She should act as the nurse of her husband's children, and having gained over his friends to her side, should through them make him acquainted of her devotion to him. In religious ceremonies she should be a leader, as also in vows and fasts, and should not hold too good an opinion of herself. When her husband is lying on his bed she should only go near him when it is agreeable to him, and should never rebuke him, or show obstinacy in any way. If her husband happens to quarrel with any of his other wives, she should reconcile them to each other, and if he desires to see any woman secretly, she should manage to bring about the meeting between them. She should moreover make herself acquainted with the weak points of her husband's character, but always keep them secret, and on the whole behave herself in such an way as may lead him to look upon her as a good and devoted wife.</p>
<p>Here ends the conduct of a wife disliked by her husband.</p>
<p>The above sections will show how all the women of the King's seraglio are to behave, and therefore we shall now speak separately only about the king.</p>
<p>The female attendants in the harem (called severally Kanchukiyas,<a id="FNanchor_54_54"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor pginternal">[54]</a> Mahallarikas,<a id="FNanchor_55_55"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor pginternal">[55]</a> and Mahallikas,<a id="FNanchor_56_56"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor pginternal">[56]</a>) should bring <a id="Page_106" class="pageno" title="[106]"/>flowers, ointments and clothes from the King's wives to the King, and he having received these things should give them as presents to the servants, along with the things worn by him the previous day. In the afternoon the King, having dressed and put on his ornaments, should interview the women of the harem, who should also be dressed and decorated with jewels. Then having given to each of them such a place and such respect as may suit the occasion and as they may deserve, he should carry on with them a cheerful conversation. After that he should see such of his wives as may be virgin widows re-married, and after them the concubines and dancing girls. All of these should be visited in their own private rooms.</p>
<p>When the King rises from his noonday sleep, the woman whose duty it is to inform the King regarding the wife who is to spend the night with him should come to him accompanied by the female attendants of that wife whose turn may have arrived in the regular course, and of her who may have been accidentally passed over as her turn arrived, and of her who may have been unwell at the <a id="corr25"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn25" title="changed from 'ttme'">time</a> of her turn. These attendants should place before the King the ointments and unguents sent by each of these wives, marked with the seal of her ring, and their names and their reasons for sending the ointments should be told to the King. After this the King accepts the ointment of one of them, who then is informed that her ointment has been accepted, and that her day has been settled.<a id="FNanchor_57_57"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor pginternal">[57]</a></p>
<p>At festivals, singing parties and exhibitions, all the wives of the King should be treated with respect and served with drinks.</p>
<p>But the women of the harem should not be allowed to go out alone, neither should any women outside the harem be allowed to enter it except those whose character is well known. And lastly the work which the King's wives have to do should not be too fatiguing.</p>
<p>Thus ends the conduct of the King towards the women of the harem, and of their own conduct.</p>
<p><a id="Page_107" class="pageno" title="[107]"/>A man marrying many wives should act fairly towards them all. He should neither disregard nor pass over their faults, and should not reveal to one wife the love, passion, bodily blemishes, and confidential reproaches of the other. No opportunity should be given to any one of them of speaking to him about their rivals, and if one of them should begin to speak ill of another, he should chide her and tell her that she has exactly the same blemishes in her character. One of them he should please by secret confidence, another by secret respect, and another by secret flattery, and he should please them all by going to gardens, by amusements, by presents, by honouring their relations, by telling them secrets, and lastly by loving unions. A young woman who is of a good temper, and who conducts herself according to the precepts of the Holy Writ, wins her husband's attachment, and obtains a superiority over her rivals.</p>
<p>Thus ends the conduct of a husband towards many wives.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00058">OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MEN AND WOMEN.—THE REASONS WHY WOMEN REJECT THE ADDRESSES OF MEN.—ABOUT MEN WHO HAVE SUCCESS WITH WOMEN, AND ABOUT WOMEN WHO ARE EASILY GAINED OVER.</h3>
<p>The wives of other people may be resorted to on the occasions already described in Part I., Chapter <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-1.htm.html#CHAPTER_PI_V" class="pginternal">5</a>, of this work, but the possibility of their acquisition, their fitness for cohabitation, the danger to oneself in uniting with them, and the future effect of these unions, should first of all be examined. A man may resort to the wife of another, for the purpose of saving his own life, when he perceives that his love for her proceeds from one degree of intensity to another. These degrees are ten in number, and are distinguished by the following marks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Love of the eye.</li>
<li>Attachment of the mind.</li>
<li>Constant reflection.</li>
<li>Destruction of sleep.</li>
<li>Emaciation of the body.</li>
<li>Turning away from objects of enjoyment.</li>
<li>Removal of shame.</li>
<li>Madness.</li>
<li>Fainting.</li>
<li>Death.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ancient authors say that a man should know the disposition, truthfulness, purity, and will of a young woman, as also the intensity, or weakness of her passions, from the form of her body, and from her characteristic marks and signs. But Vatsyayana is of opinion that the forms of bodies, and the characteristic<a id="Page_109" class="pageno" title="[109]"/> marks or signs are but erring tests of character, and that women should be judged by their conduct, by the outward expression of their thoughts, and by the movements of their bodies.</p>
<p>Now as a general rule Gonikaputra says that a woman falls in love with every handsome man she sees, and so does every man at the sight of a beautiful woman, but frequently they do not take any further steps, owing to various considerations. In love the following circumstances are peculiar to the woman. She loves without regard to right or wrong,<a id="FNanchor_58_58"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor pginternal">[58]</a> and does not try to gain over a man simply for the attainment of some particular purpose. Moreover, when a man first makes up to her she naturally shrinks from him, even though she may be willing to unite herself with him. But when the attempts to gain her are repeated and renewed, she at last consents. But with a man, even though he may have begun to love, he conquers his feelings from a regard for morality and wisdom, and although his thoughts are often on the woman, he does not yield, even though an attempt be made to gain him over. He sometimes makes an attempt or effort to win the object of his affections, and having failed, he leaves her alone for the future. In the same way, when a woman is once gained, he often becomes indifferent about her. As for the saying that a man does not care for what is easily gained, and only desires a thing which cannot be obtained without difficulty, it is only a matter of talk.</p>
<p>The causes of a woman rejecting the addresses of a man are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Affection for her husband.</li>
<li>Desire of lawful progeny.</li>
<li>Want of opportunity.</li>
<li>Anger at being addressed by the man too familiarly.</li>
<li>Difference in rank of life.</li>
<li>Want of certainty on account of the man being devoted to travelling.</li>
<li>Thinking that the man may be attached to some other person.</li>
<li>Fear of the man's not keeping his intentions secret.</li>
<li>Thinking that the man is too devoted to his friends, and has too great a regard for them.</li>
<li><a id="Page_110" class="pageno" title="[110]"/>The apprehension that he is not in earnest.</li>
<li>Bashfulness on account of his being an illustrious man.</li>
<li>Fear on account of his being powerful, or possessed of too impetuous passion, in the case of the deer woman.</li>
<li>Bashfulness on account of his being too clever.</li>
<li>The thought of having once lived with him on friendly terms only.</li>
<li>Contempt of his want of knowledge of the world.</li>
<li>Distrust of his low character.</li>
<li>Disgust at his want of perception of her love for him.</li>
<li>In the case of an elephant woman, the thought that he is a hare man, or a man of weak passion.</li>
<li>Compassion lest any thing should befall him on account of his passion.</li>
<li>Despair at her own imperfections.</li>
<li>Fear of discovery.</li>
<li>Disillusion at seeing his grey hair or shabby appearance.</li>
<li>Fear that he may be employed by her husband to test her chastity.</li>
<li>The thought that he has too much regard for morality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whichever of the above causes a man may detect, he should endeavour to remove it from the very beginning. Thus, the bashfulness that may arise from his greatness or his ability, he should remove by showing his great love and affection for her. The difficulty of the want of opportunity, or if his <a id="corr26"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn26" title="changed from 'inaccesibility'">inaccessibility</a>, he should remove by showing her some easy way of access. The excessive respect entertained by the woman for him should be removed by making himself very familiar. The difficulties that arise from his being thought a low character he should remove by showing his valour and his wisdom; those that come from neglect by extra attention; and those that arise from fear by giving her proper encouragement.</p>
<p>The following are the men who generally obtain success with women.</p>
<ol>
<li>Men well versed in the science of love.</li>
<li>Men skilled in telling stories.</li>

<p>There was also two verses on the subject as follows:</p>
<p>"Desire, which springs from nature, and which is increased by art, and from which all danger is taken away by wisdom, becomes firm and secure. A clever man, depending on his own ability, and observing carefully the ideas and thoughts of women, and removing the causes of their turning away from men, is generally successful with them."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00059"><a id="CHAPTER_PV_II"/>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00060">ABOUT MAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE WOMAN, AND OF THE EFFORTS TO GAIN HER OVER.</h3>
<p>Ancient authors are of opinion that girls are not so easily seduced by employing female messengers as by the efforts of the man himself, but that the wives of others are more easily got at by the aid of female messengers than by the personal efforts of a man. But Vatsyayana lays it down that whenever it is possible a man should always act himself in these matters, and it is only when such is impracticable, or impossible, that female messengers should be employed. As for the saying that women who act and talk boldly and freely are to be won by the personal efforts of the man, and that women who do not possess those qualities are to be got at by female messengers, it is only a matter of talk.</p>
<p>Now when a man acts himself in the matter he should first of all make the acquaintance of the woman he loves in the following manner.</p>
<p>1st. He should arrange to be seen by the woman either on a natural or special opportunity. A natural opportunity is when one of them goes to the house of the other, and a special opportunity is when they meet either at the house of a friend, or a caste-fellow, or a minister, or a physician, as also on the occasion of marriage ceremonies, sacrifices, festivals, funerals, and garden parties.</p>
<p>2nd. When they do meet, the man should be careful to look at her in such a way as to cause the state of his mind to be made known to her; he should pull about his moustache, make a sound with his nails, cause his own ornaments to tinkle, bite his lower lip, and make various other signs of that description. When she is looking at him he should<a id="Page_114" class="pageno" title="[114]"/> speak to his friends about her and other women, and should show to her his liberality and his appreciation of enjoyments. When sitting by the side of a female friend he should yawn and twist his body, contract his eyebrows, speak very slowly as if he were weary, and listen to her indifferently. A conversation having two meanings should also be carried on with a child or some other person, apparently having regard to a third person, but really having reference to the woman he loves, and in this way his love should be made manifest under the pretext of referring to others rather than to herself. He should make marks that have reference to her, on the earth with his nails, or with a stick, and should embrace and kiss a child in her presence, and give it the mixture of betel nut and betel leaves with his tongue, and press its chin with his fingers in a caressing way. All these things should be done at the proper time and in proper places.</p>
<p>3rd. The man should fondle a child that may be sitting on her lap, and give it something to play with, and also take the same back again. Conversation with respect to the child may also be held with her, and in this manner he should gradually become well acquainted with her, and he should also make himself agreeable to her relations. Afterwards, this acquaintance should be made a pretext for visiting her house frequently, and on such occasions he should converse on the subject of love in her absence, but within her hearing. As his intimacy with her increases he should place in her charge some kind of deposit or trust, and take away from it a small portion at a time; or he may give her some fragrant substances, or betel nuts to be kept for him by her. After this he should endeavour to make her well acquainted with his own wife, and get them to carry on confidential conversations, and to sit together in lonely places. In order to see her frequently he should arrange that the same goldsmith, the same jeweller, the same basket maker, the same dyer, and the same washerman should be employed by the two families. And he should also pay her long visits openly under the pretence of being engaged with her on business, and one business should lead to another, so as to keep up the intercourse between them. Whenever she wants any<a id="Page_115" class="pageno" title="[115]"/>thing, or is in need of money, or wishes to acquire skill in one of the arts, he should cause her to understand that he is willing and able to do anything that she wants, to give her money, or teach her one of the arts, all these things being quite within his ability and power. In the same way he should hold discussions with her in company with other people, and they should talk of the doings and sayings of other persons, and examine different things, like jewellery, precious stones, etc. On such occasions he should show her certain things with the values of which she may be unacquainted, and if she begins to dispute with him about the things or their value, he should not contradict her, but point out that he agrees with her in every way.</p>
<p>Thus ends the ways of making the acquaintance of the woman desired.</p>
<p>Now after a girl has become acquainted with the man as above described, and has manifested her love to him by the various outward signs; and by the motions of her body, the man should make every effort to gain her over. But as girls are not acquainted with sexual union, they should be treated with the greatest delicacy, and the man should proceed with considerable caution, though in the case of other women, accustomed to sexual intercourse, this is not necessary. When the intentions of the girl are known, and her bashfulness put aside, the man should begin to make use of her money, and an interchange of clothes, rings, and flowers should be made. In this the man should take particular care that the things given by him are handsome and valuable. He should moreover receive from her a mixture of betel nut and betel leaves, and when he is going to a party he should ask for the flower in her hair, or for the flower in her hand. If he himself gives her a flower it should be a sweet smelling one, and marked with marks made by his nails or teeth. With increasing assiduity he should dispel her fears, and by degrees get her to go with him to some lonely place, and there he should embrace and kiss her. And finally at the time of giving her some betel nut, or of receiving the same from her, or at the time of making an exchange of flowers, he should touch and press her private parts, thus bringing his efforts to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<p><a id="Page_116" class="pageno" title="[116]"/>When a man is endeavouring to seduce one woman, he should not attempt to seduce any other at the same time. But after he had succeeded with the first, and enjoyed her for a considerable time, he can keep her affections by giving her presents that she likes, and then commence making up to another woman. When a man sees the husband of a woman going to some place near his house, he should not enjoy the woman then, even though she may be easily gained over at that time. A wise man having a regard for his reputation should not think of seducing a woman who is apprehensive, timid, not to be trusted, well guarded, or possessed of a father-in-law, or mother-in-law.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00062">EXAMINATION OF THE STATE OF A WOMAN'S MIND.</h3>
<p>When a man is trying to gain over a woman he should examine the state of her mind, and acts as follows.</p>
<p>If she listens to him, but does not manifest to him in any way her own intentions, he should then try to gain her over by means of a go-between.</p>
<p>If she meets him once, and again comes to meet him better dressed <a id="corr28"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn28" title="changed from 'that'">than</a> before, or comes to him in some lonely place, he should be certain that she is capable of being enjoyed by the use of a little force. A woman who lets a man make up to her, but does not give herself up, even after a long time, should be considered as a trifler in love, but owing to the fickleness of the human mind, even such a woman can be conquered by always keeping up a close acquaintance with her.</p>
<p>When a woman avoids the attentions of a man, and on account of respect for him, and pride in herself, will not meet him or approach him, she can be gained over with difficulty, either by endeavouring to keep on familiar terms with her, or else by an exceedingly clever go-between.</p>
<p>When a man makes up to a woman, and she reproaches him with harsh words, she should be abandoned at once.</p>
<p>When a woman reproaches a man, but at the same time acts affectionately towards him, she should be made love to in every way.</p>
<p>A woman who meets a man in lonely places, and puts up with the touch of his foot, but pretends, on account of the indecision of her mind, not to be aware of it, should be conquered by patience, and by continued efforts as follows:</p>
<p>If she happens to go to sleep in his vicinity he should put his left arm round her, and see when she awakes whether she repulses him in reality, or only repulses him in such a way as if she were desirous of the same thing being done to her again.<a id="Page_118" class="pageno" title="[118]"/> And what is done by the arm can also be done by the foot. If the man succeeds in this point he should embrace her more closely, and if she will not stand the embrace and gets up, but behaves with him as usual the next day, he should consider then that she is not unwilling to be enjoyed by him. If however she does not appear again, the man should try to get over her by means of a go-between; and if, after having disappeared for some time she again appears, and behaves with him as usual, the man should then consider that she would not object to be united with him.</p>
<p>When a woman gives a man an opportunity, and makes her own love manifest to him, he should proceed to enjoy her. And the signs of a woman manifesting her love are these:</p>
<ol>
<li>She calls out to a man without being addressed by him in the first instance.</li>
<li>She shows herself to him in secret places.</li>
<li>She speaks to him tremblingly and inarticulately.</li>
<li>She has the fingers of her hand, and the toes of her feet moistened with perspiration, and her face blooming with delight.</li>
<li>She occupies herself with shampooing his body and pressing his head.</li>
<li>When shampooing him she works with one hand only, and with the other she touches and embraces parts of his body.</li>
<li>She remains with both hands placed on his body motionless as if she had been surprised by something, or was overcome by fatigue.</li>
<li>She sometimes bends down her face upon his thighs, and when asked to shampoo them does not manifest any unwillingness to do so.</li>
<li>She places one of her hands quite motionless on his body, and even though the man should press it between two members of his body, she does not remove it for a long time.</li>
<li>Lastly, when she has resisted all the efforts of the man to gain her over, she returns to him next day to shampoo his body as before.</li>
</ol>
<p>When a woman neither gives encouragement to a man, nor avoids him, but hides herself and remains in some lonely place, she must be got at by means of the female servant who may<a id="Page_119" class="pageno" title="[119]"/> be near her. If when called by the man she acts in the same way, then she should be gained over by means of a skilful go-between. But if she will have nothing to say to the man, he should consider well about her before he begins any further attempts to gain her over.</p>
<p>Thus ends the examination of the state of a woman's mind.</p>
<p>A man should first get himself introduced to a woman, and then carry on a conversation with her. He should give her hints of his love for her, and if he finds from her replies that she receives these hints favourably, he should then set to work to gain her over without any fear. A woman who shows her love by outward signs to the man at his first interview should be gained over very easily. In the same way a lascivious woman, who when addressed in loving words replies openly in words expressive of her love, should be considered to have been gained over at that very moment. With regard to all women, whether they be wise, simple, or confiding, this rule is laid down that those who make an open manifestation of their love are easily gained over.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00063"><a id="CHAPTER_PV_IV"/>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00064">ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF A GO-BETWEEN.</h3>
<p>If a woman has manifested her love or desire, either by signs or by motions of her body, and is afterwards rarely or never seen any where, or if a woman is met for the first time, the man should get a go-between to approach her.</p>
<p>Now the go-between, having wheedled herself into the confidence of the woman by acting according to her disposition, should try to make her hate or despise her husband by holding artful conversations with her, by telling her about medicines for getting children, by talking to her about other people, by tales of various kinds, by stories about the wives of other men, and by praising her beauty, wisdom, generosity, and good nature, and then saying to her: "It is indeed a pity that you, who are so excellent a woman in every way, should be possessed of a husband of this kind. Beautiful lady, he is not fit even to serve you." The go-between should further talk to the woman about the weakness of the passion of her husband, his jealousy, his roguery, his ingratitude, his aversion to enjoyments, his dullness, his meanness, and all the other faults that he may have, and with which she may be acquainted. She should particularly harp upon that fault or that failing by which the wife may appear to be the most affected. If the wife be a deer woman, and the husband a hare man, then there would be no fault in that direction, but in the event of his being a hare man, and she a mare woman or elephant woman, then this fault should be pointed out to her.</p>
<p>Gonikaputra is of opinion that when it is the first affair of the woman, or when her love has only been very secretly shown, the man should then secure and send to her a go-<a id="Page_121" class="pageno" title="[121]"/>between, with whom she may be already acquainted, and in whom she confides.</p>
<p>But to return to our subject. The go-between should tell the woman about the obedience and love of the man, and as her confidence and affection increase, she should then explain to her the thing to be accomplished in the following way. "Hear this, Oh beautiful lady, that this man, born of a good family, having seen you, has gone mad on your account. The poor young man, who is tender by nature, has never been distressed in such a way before, and it is highly probable that he will succumb under his present affliction, and experience the pains of death." If the woman listens with a favourable ear, then on the following day the go-between, having observed marks of good spirits in her face, in her eyes, and in her manner of conversation, should again converse with her on the subject of the man, and should tell her the stories of Ahalya<a id="FNanchor_59_59"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor pginternal">[59]</a> and Indra, of Sakoontala<a id="FNanchor_60_60"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor pginternal">[60]</a> and Dushyanti, and such others as may be fitted for the occasion. She should also describe to her the strength of the man, his talents, his skill in the sixty-four sorts of enjoyments mentioned by Babhravya, his good looks, and his liaison with some praiseworthy woman, no matter whether this last ever took place or not.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the go-between should carefully note the behaviour of the woman, which if favourable would be as follows: She would address her with a smiling look, would seat herself close beside her, and ask her, "Where have you been? What have you been doing? Where did you dine? Where did you sleep? Where have you been sitting?" Moreover the woman would meet the go-between in lonely places and tell her stories there, would yawn contemplatively, draw long sighs, give her presents, remember her on occasions of festivals, dismiss <a id="Page_122" class="pageno" title="[122]"/>her with a wish to see her again, and say to her jestingly, "Oh, well-speaking woman, why do you speak these bad words to me?" would discourse on the sin of her union with the man, would not tell her about any previous visits or conversations that she may have had with him, but wish to be asked about these, and lastly would laugh at the man's desire, but would not reproach him in any way.</p>
<p>Thus ends the behaviour of the woman with the go-between.</p>
<p>When the woman manifests her love in the manner above described, the go-between should increase it by bringing to her love tokens from the man. But if the woman be not acquainted with the man personally, the go-between should win her over by extolling and praising his good qualities, and by telling stories about his love for her. Here Auddalaka says that when a man or woman are not personally acquainted with each other, and have not shown each other any signs of affection, the employment of a go-between is useless.</p>
<p>The followers of Babhravya on the other hand affirm that even though they be personally unacquainted, but have shown each other signs of affection there is an occasion for the employment of a go-between. Gonikaputra asserts that a go-between should be employed, provided they are acquainted with each other, even though no signs of affection may have passed between them. Vatsyayana however lays it down that even though they may not be personally acquainted with each other, and may not have shown each other any signs of affection, still they are both capable of placing confidence in a go-between.</p>
<p>Now the go-between should show the woman the presents, such as the betel nut and betel leaves, the perfumes, the flowers, and the rings which the man may have given to her for the sake of the woman, and on these presents should be impressed the marks of the man's teeth, and nails, and other signs. On the cloth that he may send he should draw with saffron both his hands joined together as if in earnest entreaty.</p>
<p>The go-between should also show to the woman ornamental figures of various kinds cut in leaves, together with ear ornaments, and chaplets made of flowers containing love letters<a id="Page_123" class="pageno" title="[123]"/> expressive of the desire of the man,<a id="FNanchor_61_61"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor pginternal">[61]</a> and she should cause her to send affectionate presents to the man in return. After they have mutually accepted each other's presents, then a meeting should be arranged between them on the faith of the go-between.</p>
<p>The followers of Babhravya say that this meeting should take place at the time of going to the temple of a Deity, or on occasions of fairs, garden parties, theatrical performances, marriages, sacrifices, festivals and funerals, as also at the time of going to the river to bathe, or at times of natural calamities,<a id="FNanchor_62_62"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor pginternal">[62]</a> fear of robbers or hostile invasions of the country.</p>
<p>Gonikaputra is of opinion however that these meetings had better be brought about in the abodes of female friends, mendicants, astrologers, and ascetics. But Vatsyayana decides that that place is only well suited for the purpose which has proper means of ingress and egress, and where arrangements have been made to prevent any accidental occurrence, and when a man who has once entered the house, can also leave it at the proper time without any disagreeable encounter.</p>
<p>Now go-betweens or female messengers are of the following different kinds, viz.:</p>
<ol>
<li>A go-between who takes upon herself the whole burden of the business.</li>
<li>A go-between who does only a limited part of the business.</li>
<li>A go-between who is the bearer of a letter only.</li>
<li><a id="Page_124" class="pageno" title="[124]"/>A go-between acting on her own account.</li>
<li>The go-between of an innocent young woman.</li>
<li>A wife serving as a go-between.</li>
<li>A mute go-between.</li>
<li>A go-between who acts the part of the wind.</li>
</ol>
<p>(1). A woman who, having observed the mutual passion of a man and woman, brings them together and arranges it by the power of her own intellect, such an one is called a go-between who takes upon herself the whole burden of the business. This kind of go-between is chiefly employed when the man and the woman are already acquainted with each other, and have conversed together, and in such cases she is sent not only by the man (as is always done in all other cases) but by the woman also.—The above name is also given to a go-between who, perceiving that the man and the woman are suited to each other, tries to bring about a union between them, even though they be not acquainted with each other.</p>
<p>(2). A go-between who, perceiving that some part of the affair is already done, or that the advances on the part of the man are already made, completes the rest of the business, is called a go-between who performs only a limited part of the business.</p>
<p>(3). A go-between, who simply carries messages between a man and a woman, who love each other, but who cannot frequently meet, is called the bearer of a letter or message.</p>
<p>This name is also given to one who is sent by either of the lovers to acquaint either the one or the other with the time and place of their meeting.</p>
<p>(4). A woman who goes herself to a man, and tells him of her having enjoyed sexual union with him in a dream, and expresses her anger at his wife having rebuked him for calling her by the name of her rival instead of by her own name, and gives him something bearing the marks of her teeth and nails, and informs him that she knew she was formerly desired by him, and asks him privately whether she or his wife is the best looking, such a person is called a woman who is a go-between for herself. Now such a woman should be met and interviewed by the man in private and secretly.</p>
<p>The above name is also given to a woman who having made<a id="Page_125" class="pageno" title="[125]"/> an agreement with some other woman to act as her go-between, gains over the man to herself, by the means of making him personally acquainted with herself, and thus causes the other woman to fail. The same applies to a man who, acting as a go-between for another, and having no previous connection with the woman, gains her over for himself, and thus causes the failure of the other man.</p>
<p>(5). A woman, who has gained the confidence of the innocent young wife of any man, and who has learned her secrets without exercising any pressure on her mind, and found out from her how her husband behaves to her, if this woman then teaches her the art of securing his favour, and decorates her so as to show her love, and instructs her how and when to be angry, or to pretend to be so, and then, having herself made marks of the nails and teeth on the body of the wife, gets the latter to send for her husband to show these marks to him, and thus excite him for enjoyment, such is called the go-between of an innocent young woman. In such cases the man should send replies to his wife through the same woman.</p>
<p>(6). When a man gets his wife to gain the confidence of a woman whom he wants to enjoy, and to call on her and talk to her about the wisdom and ability of her husband, that wife is called a wife serving as a go-between. In this case the feelings of the woman with regard to the man should also be made known through the wife.</p>
<p>(7). When any man sends a girl or a female servant to any woman under some pretext or other, and places a letter in her bouquet of flowers, or in her ear ornaments, or marks something about her with his teeth or nails, that girl or female servant is called a mute go-between. In this case the man should expect an answer from the woman through the same person.</p>
<p>(8). A person, who carries a message to a woman, which has a double meaning, or which relates to some past transactions, or which is unintelligible to other people, is called a go-between who acts the part of the wind. In this case the reply should be asked for through the same woman.</p>
<p>Thus end the different kinds of go-betweens.</p>
<p>A female astrologer, a female servant, a female beggar, or<a id="Page_126" class="pageno" title="[126]"/> a female artist are well acquainted with the business of a go-between, and very soon gain the confidence of other women. Any one of them can raise enmity between any two persons if she wishes to do so, or extol the loveliness of any woman that she wishes to praise, or describe the arts practised by other women in sexual union. They can also speak highly of the love of a man, of his skill in sexual enjoyment, and of the desire of other women, more beautiful even than the woman they are addressing, for him, and explain the restraint under which he may be at home.</p>
<p>Lastly a go-between can, by the artfulness of her conversation unite a woman with a man, even though he may not have been thought of by her, or may have been considered beyond his aspirations. She can also bring back a man to a woman, who, owing to some cause or other, has separated himself from her.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00065"><a id="CHAPTER_PV_V"/>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00066">ABOUT THE LOVE OF PERSONS IN AUTHORITY FOR THE WIVES OF OTHER MEN.</h3>
<p>Kings and their ministers have no access to the abodes of others, and moreover their mode of living is constantly watched and observed and imitated by the people at large, just as the animal world, seeing the sun rise, get up after him, and when he sits in the evening, lie down again in the same way. Persons in authority should not therefore do any improper act in public, as such are impossible from their position, and would be deserving of censure. But if they find that such an act is necessary to be done, they should make use of the proper means as described in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>The head man of the village, the King's officer employed there, and the man<a id="FNanchor_63_63"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor pginternal">[63]</a> whose business it is to glean corn, can gain over female villagers simply by asking them. It is on this account that this class of woman are called unchaste women by voluptuaries.</p>
<p>The union of the above mentioned men with this class of woman takes place on the occasions of unpaid labour, of filling the granaries in their houses, of taking things in and out of the house, of cleaning the houses, of working in the fields, and of purchasing cotton, wool, flax, hemp, and thread, and at the season of the purchase, sale, and exchange of various other articles, as well as at the time of doing various other works. In the same way the superintendents of cow pens enjoy the women in the cow pens; and the officers, who have the superintendence of widows, of the women who are without<a id="Page_128" class="pageno" title="[128]"/> supporters, and of women who have left their husbands, have sexual intercourse with these women. The intelligent accomplish their object by wandering at night in the village, and while villagers also unite with the wives of their sons, being much alone with them. Lastly the superintendents of markets have a great deal to do with the female villagers at the time of their making purchases in the market.</p>
<p>During the festival of the eighth moon, <i>i.e.</i>, during the bright half of the month of Nargashirsha, as also during the <a id="corr29"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn29" title="changed from 'moon-light'">moonlight</a> festival of the month of Kartika, and the spring festival of Chaitra, the women of cities and towns generally visit the women of the King's harem in the royal palace. These visitors go to the several apartments of the women of the harem, as they are acquainted with them, and pass the night in conversation, and in proper sports, and amusement, and go away in the morning. On such occasions a female attendant of the King (previously acquainted with the woman whom the King desires), should loiter about, and accost this woman when she sets out to go home, and induce her to come and see the amusing things in the palace. Previous to these festivals even, she should have caused it to be intimated to this woman that on the occasion of this festival she would show her all the interesting things in the royal palace. Accordingly she should show her the bower of the coral creeper, the garden house with its floor inlaid with precious stones, the bower of grapes, the building on the water, the secret passages in the walls of the palace, the pictures, the sporting animals, the machines, the birds, and the cages of the lions and the tigers. After this, when alone with her, she should tell her about the love of the King for her, and should describe to her the good fortune which would attend upon her union with the King, giving her at the time a strict promise of secrecy. If the woman does not accept the offer, she should conciliate and please her with handsome presents befitting the position of the King, and having accompanied her for some distance should dismiss her with great affection.</p>
<p>(2). Or, having made the acquaintance of the husband of the woman whom the King desires, the wives of the King<a id="Page_129" class="pageno" title="[129]"/> should get the wife to pay them a visit in the harem, and on this occasion a female attendant of the King, having been sent thither, should act as above described.</p>
<p>(3). Or, one of the King's wives should get acquainted with the woman that the King desires, by sending one of the female attendants to her, who should, on their becoming more intimate, induce her to come and see the royal abode. Afterwards, when she has visited the harem, and acquired confidence, a female confidante of the King, sent thither, should act as before described.</p>
<p>(4). Or, the King's wife should invite the woman, whom the King desires, to come to the royal palace, so that she might see the practice of the art in which the King's wife may be skilled, and after she has come to the harem, a female attendant of the King, sent thither, should act as before described.</p>
<p>(5). Or, a female beggar, in league with the King's wife, should say to the woman desired by the King, and whose husband may have lost his wealth, or may have some cause of fear from the King: "This wife of the King has influence over him, and she is, moreover, naturally kind-hearted, we must therefore go to her in this matter. I shall arrange for your entrance into the harem, and she will do away with all cause of danger and fear from the King." If the woman accepts this offer, the female beggar should take her two or three times to the harem, and the King's wife there should give her a promise of protection. After this, when the woman, delighted with her reception and promise of protection, again goes to the harem, then a female attendant of the King, sent thither, should act as directed.</p>
<p>(6). What has been said above regarding the wife of one who has some cause of fear from the King applies also to the wives of those who seek service under the King, or who are oppressed by the King's ministers, or who are poor, or who are not satisfied with their position, or who are desirous of gaining the King's favour, or who wish to become famous among the people, or who are oppressed by the members of their own caste, or who want to injure their caste fellows,<a id="Page_130" class="pageno" title="[130]"/> or who are spies of the King, or who have any other object to attain.</p>
<p>(7). Lastly, if the woman desired by the King be living with some person who is not her husband, then the King should cause her to be arrested, and having made her a slave, on account of her crime, should place her in the harem. Or the King should cause his ambassador to quarrel with the husband of the woman desired by him, and should then imprison her as the wife of an enemy of the King, and by this means should place her in the harem.</p>
<p>Thus end the means of gaining over the wives of others secretly.</p>
<p>The above mentioned ways of gaining over the wives of other men are chiefly practised in the palaces of Kings. But a King should never enter the abode of another person, for Abhira,<a id="FNanchor_64_64"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor pginternal">[64]</a> the King of the Kottas was killed by a washerman while in the house of another, and in the same way Jayasana the King of the Kashis was slain by the commandment of his cavalry.</p>
<p>But according to the customs of some countries there are facilities for Kings to make love to the wives of other men. Thus in the country of the Andras<a id="FNanchor_65_65"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor pginternal">[65]</a> the newly married daughters of the people thereof enter the King's harem with some presents on the tenth day of their marriage, and having been enjoyed by the King are then dismissed. In the country of the Vatsagulmas<a id="FNanchor_66_66"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor pginternal">[66]</a> the wives of the chief ministers approach the King at night to serve him. In the country of the Vaidarbhas<a id="FNanchor_67_67"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor pginternal">[67]</a> the beautiful wives of the inhabitants pass a month in the King's harem under the pretence of affection for the King. In the country of the Aparatakas<a id="FNanchor_68_68"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor pginternal">[68]</a> the people gave their beautiful wives as presents to the ministers and the</p>
<p><a id="Page_131" class="pageno" title="[131]"/></p>
<p>Kings. And lastly in the country of the Saurashtras<a id="FNanchor_69_69"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor pginternal">[69]</a> the women of the city and the country enter the royal harem for the King's pleasure either together or separately.</p>
<p>There are also two verses on the subject as follows:</p>
<p>"The above and other ways are the means employed in different countries by Kings with regard to the wives of other persons. But a King, who has the welfare of his people at heart, should not on any account put them into practice."</p>
<p>"A King who has conquered the six<a id="FNanchor_70_70"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor pginternal">[70]</a> enemies of mankind, becomes the master of the whole earth."</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00068">ABOUT THE WOMEN OF THE ROYAL HAREM; AND OF THE KEEPING OF ONE'S OWN WIFE.</h3>
<p>The women of the royal harem cannot see or meet any men on account of their being strictly guarded, neither do they have their desires satisfied, because their only husband is common to many wives. For this reason among themselves they give pleasure to each other in various ways as now described.</p>
<p>Having dressed the daughters of their nurses, or their female friends, or their female attendants, like men, they accomplish their object by means of bulbs, roots, and fruits having the form of the Lingam, or they lie down upon the statue of a male figure, in which the Lingam is visible and erect.</p>
<p>Some Kings, who are compassionate, take or apply certain medicines to enable them to enjoy many wives in one night, simply for the purpose of satisfying the desire of their women, though they perhaps have no desire of their own. Others enjoy with great affection only those wives that they particularly like, while others only take them according as the turn of each wife arrives in due course. Such are the ways of enjoyment prevalent in Eastern countries, and what is said about the means of enjoyment of the female is also applicable to the male.</p>
<p>By means of their female attendants the ladies of the royal harem generally get men into their apartments in the disguise or dress of women. Their female attendants, and the daughters of their nurses, who are acquainted with their secrets, should exert themselves to get men to come to the harem in this way by <a id="corr30"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn30" title="changed from 't lling'">telling</a> them of the good fortune attending it, and by describing the facilities of entering and leaving the palace, the<a id="Page_133" class="pageno" title="[133]"/> large size of the premises, the carelessness of the sentinels, and the irregularities of the attendants about the persons of the royal wives. But these women should never induce a man to enter the harem by telling him falsehoods, for that would probably lead to his destruction.</p>
<p>As for the man himself, he had better not enter a royal harem, even though it may be easily <a id="corr31"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn31" title="changed from 'accesible'">accessible</a>, on account of the numerous disasters to which he may be exposed there. If however he wants to enter it, he should first ascertain whether there is an easy way to get out, whether it is closely surrounded by the pleasure garden, whether it has separate enclosures belonging to it, whether the sentinels are careless, whether the King has gone abroad, and then, when he is called by the women of the harem, he should carefully observe the localities, and enter by the way pointed out by them. If he is able to manage it, he should hang about the harem every day, and, under some pretext or other, make friends with the sentinels, and show himself attached to the female attendants of the harem, who may have become acquainted with his design, and to whom he should express his regret at not being able to obtain the object of his desire. Lastly he should cause the whole business of a go-between to be done by the woman who may have access to the harem, and he should be careful to be able to recognize the emissaries of the King.</p>
<p>When a go-between has no access to the harem, then the man should stand in some place where the lady, whom he loves, and <a id="corr32"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn32" title="changed from 'whem'">whom</a> he is anxious to enjoy, can be seen.</p>
<p>If that place is occupied by the King's sentinels, he should then disguise himself as a female attendant of the lady who comes to the place, or passes by it. When she looks at him he should let her know his feelings by outward signs and gestures, and should show her pictures, things with double meanings, chaplets of flowers, and rings. He should carefully mark the answer she gives, whether by word or by sign, or by gesture, and should then try and get into the harem. If he is certain of her coming to some particular place he should conceal himself there, and at the appointed time should enter along with her as one of the guards. He may also go in and out, concealed in a folded bed, or bed covering, or with his<a id="Page_134" class="pageno" title="[134]"/> body made invisible,<a id="FNanchor_71_71"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor pginternal">[71]</a> by means of external applications, a receipt for one of which is as follows:</p>
<p>The heart of an ichneumon, the fruit of the long gourd (Tumbi), and the eyes of the serpent, should all be burnt without letting out the smoke, the ashes should then be ground and mixed in equal quantities with water. By putting this mixture upon the eyes a man can go about unseen.</p>
<p>Other means of invisibility are prescribed by Duyana Brahmans and Jogashiras.</p>
<p>Again the man may enter the harem during the festival of the eight moon in the month of Nargashirsha, and during the moonlight festivals when the female attendants of the harem are all busily occupied, or in confusion.</p>
<p>The following principles are laid down on this subject.</p>
<p>The entrance of young men into harems, and their exit from them, generally take place when things are being brought into the palace, or when things are being taken out of it, or when drinking festivals are going on, or when the female attendants are in a hurry, or when the residence of some of the royal ladies is being changed, or when the King's wives go to gardens, or to fairs, or when they enter the palace on their return from them; or, lastly, when the King is absent on a long pilgrimage. The women of the royal harem know each other's secrets, and having but one object to attain, they give assistance to each other. A young man, who enjoys all of them, and who is common to them all, can continue enjoying his union with them so long as it is kept quiet, and is not known abroad.</p>
<p>Now in the country of the Aparatakas the royal ladies are not well protected, and consequently many young men are passed into the harem by the women who have access to the royal palaces. The wives of the King of the Ahira country accomplish their objects with those sentinels in the harem who bear the name of Kashtriyas. The royal ladies in the country of the Vatsagulmas cause such men as are suitable to enter<a id="Page_135" class="pageno" title="[135]"/> into the harem along with their female messengers. In the country of the Vaidarbhas the sons of the royal ladies enter the royal harem when they please, and enjoy the women, with the exception of their own mothers. In the Stri-rajya the wives of the King are enjoyed by his caste fellows and relations. In the Ganda country the royal wives are enjoyed by Brahmans, friends, servants, and slaves. In the Samdhava country, servants, foster children, and other persons like them enjoy the women of the harem. In the country of the Haimavatas adventurous citizens bribe the sentinels and enter the harem. In the country of the Vanyas and the Kalmyas, Brahmans, with the knowledge of the King, enter the harem under the pretence of giving flowers to the ladies, and speak with them from behind a curtain, and from such conversation union afterwards takes place. Lastly, the women in the harem of the King of the Prachyas conceal one young man in the harem for every batch of nine or ten of the women.</p>
<p>Thus act the wives of others.</p>
<p>For these reasons a man should guard his own wife. Old authors say that a King should select for sentinels in his harem such men as have their freedom from carnal desires well tested. But such men, though free themselves from carnal desire, by reason of their fear <a id="corr33"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn33" title="changed from 'of'">or</a> avarice, may cause other persons to enter the harem, and therefore Gonikaputra says, that Kings should place such men in the harem as may have had their freedom from carnal desires, their fears, and their avarice well tested. Lastly, Vatsyayana says that under the influence of Dharma<a id="FNanchor_72_72"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor pginternal">[72]</a> people might be admitted, and therefore men should be selected who are free from carnal desires, fear, avarice, and Dharma.<a id="FNanchor_73_73"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor pginternal">[73]</a></p>
<p>The followers of Babhravya say that a man should cause his wife to associate with a young woman who would tell him the secrets of other people, and thus find out from her about his wife's chastity. But Vatsyayana says, that as wicked <a id="Page_136" class="pageno" title="[136]"/>persons are always successful with women, a man should not cause his innocent wife to be corrupted by bringing her into the company of a deceitful woman.</p>
<p>The following are the causes of the destruction of a woman's chastity:</p>
<ul class="c5">
<li>Always going into society, and sitting in company.</li>
<li>Absence of restraint.</li>
<li>The loose habits of her husband.</li>
<li>Want of caution in her relations with other men.</li>
<li>Continued and long absence of her husband.</li>
<li>Living in a foreign country.</li>
<li>Destruction of her love and feelings by her husband.</li>
<li>The company of loose women.</li>
<li>The jealousy of her husband.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also the following verses on the subject.</p>
<p>"A clever man, learning from the Shastras the ways of winning over the wives of other people, is never deceived in the case of his own wives. No one, however, should make use of these ways for <a id="corr34"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn34" title="changed from 'seduciug'">seducing</a> the wives of others, because they do not always succeed, and, moreover, often cause disasters, and the destruction of Dharma and Artha. This book, which is intended for the good of the people, and to teach them the ways of guarding their own wives, should not be made use of merely for gaining over the wives of others."</p>
