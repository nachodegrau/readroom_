<h3 id="pgepubid00089">OF THE WAYS OF EXCITING DESIRE, AND MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIMENTS, AND RECIPES.</h3>
<p>If a man is unable to satisfy a Hastini, or elephant woman, he should have recourse to various means to excite her passion. At the commencement he should rub her yoni with his hand or fingers, and not begin to have intercourse with her until she becomes excited, or experiences pleasure. This is one way of exciting a woman.</p>
<p>Or, he may make use of certain Apadravyas, or things which are put on or around the lingam to supplement its length or its thickness, so as to fit it to the yoni. In the opinion of Babhravya, these Apadravyas should be made of gold, silver, copper, iron, ivory, buffalo's horn, various kinds of wood, tin or lead, and should be soft, cool, provocative of sexual vigour, and well fitted to serve the intended purpose. Vatsyayana, however, says that they may be made according to the natural liking of each individual.</p>
<p>The following are the different kinds of Apadravyas.</p>
<ol>
<li>"The armlet" (Valaya) should <a id="corr43"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn43" title="changed from 'he'">be</a> of the same size as the lingam, and should have its outer surface made rough with globules.</li>
<li>"The couple" (Sanghati) is formed of two armlets.</li>
<li>"The bracelet" (Chudaka) is made by joining three or more armlets, until they come up to the required length of the lingam.</li>
<li>"The single bracelet" is formed by wrapping a single wire around the lingam, according to its dimensions.</li>
<li>The Kantuka or Jalaka is a tube open at both ends, with a hole through it, outwardly rough and studded with soft<a id="Page_174" class="pageno" title="[174]"/> globules, and made to fit the side of the yoni, and tied to the waist.</li>
</ol>
<p>When such a thing cannot be obtained, then a tube made of the wood apple, or tubular stalk of the bottle gourd, or a reed made soft with oil and extracts of plants, and tied to the waist with strings, may be made use of, as also a row of soft pieces of wood tied together.</p>
<p>The above are the things that can be used in connection with or in the place of the lingam.</p>
<p>The people of the southern countries think that true sexual pleasure cannot be obtained without perforating the lingam, and they therefore cause it to be pierced like the lobes of the ears of an infant pierced for earrings.</p>
<p>Now, when a young man perforates his lingam he should pierce it with a sharp instrument, and then stand in water so long as the blood continues to flow. At night he should engage in sexual intercourse, even with vigour, so as to clean the hole. After this he should continue to wash the hole with decoctions, and increase the size by putting into it small pieces of cane, and the wrightia antidysenterica, and thus gradually enlarging the orifice. It may also be washed with liquorice mixed with honey, and the size of the hole increased by the fruit stalks of the sima-patra plant. The hole should be annointed with a small quantity of oil.</p>
<p>In the hole made in the lingam a man may put Apadravyas of various forms, such as the "round," the "round on one side," the "wooden mortar," the "flower," the "armlet," the "bone of the heron," the "goad of the elephant," the "collection of eight balls," the "lock of hair," the "place where four roads meet," and other things named according to their forms and means of using them. All these Apadravyas should be rough on the outside according to their requirements.</p>
<p>The ways of enlarging the lingam must be now related.</p>
<p>When a man wishes to enlarge his lingam, he should rub it with the bristles of certain insects that live in trees, and then, after rubbing it for ten nights with oils, he should again rub it with the bristles as before. By continuing to do this a swelling will be gradually produced in the lingam,<a id="Page_175" class="pageno" title="[175]"/> and he should then lie on a cot, and cause his lingam to hang down through a hole in the cot. After this he should take away all the pain from the swelling by using cool concoctions. The swelling, which is called "Suka," and is often brought about among the people of the Dravida country, lasts for life.</p>
<p>If the lingam is rubbed with the following things, viz., the plant physalis flexuosa, the shavara-kandaka plant, the jalasuka plant, the fruit of the egg plant, the butter of a she buffalo, the hastri-charma plant, and the juice of the vajra-rasa plant, a swelling lasting for one month will be produced.</p>
<p>By rubbing it with oil boiled in the concoctions of the above things, the same effect will be produced, but lasting for six months.</p>
<p>The enlargement of the lingam is also effected by rubbing it or moistening it with oil boiled on a moderate fire along with the seeds of the <a id="corr44"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn44" title="changed from 'pomegranite'">pomegranate</a>, and the cucumber, the juices of the valuka plant, the hasti-charma plant, and the egg-plant.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, other means may be learnt from experienced and confidential persons.</p>
<p>The miscellaneous experiments and recipes are as follows:</p>
<p>(a). If a man mixes the powder of the milk hedge plant, and the kantaka plant with the excrement of a monkey, and the powdered root of the lanjalalika plant, and throws this mixture on a woman, she will not love any body else afterwards.</p>
<p>(b). If a man thickens the juice of the fruits of the cassia fistula, and the eugenia jambolana by mixing them with the powder of the soma plant, the vernonia anthelmintica, the eclipta prostata, and the lohopa-jihirka, and applies this composition to the yoni of a woman, and then has sexual intercourse with her, his love for her will be destroyed.</p>
<p>(c). The same effect is produced if a man has connection with a woman who has bathed in the butter-milk of a she-buffalo mixed with the powders of the gopalika plant, the banu-padika plant, and the yellow amaranth.</p>
<p>(d). An ointment made of the flowers of the nauclea cadamba, the hog plum, and the eugenia jambolana, and used by a woman, causes her to be disliked by her husband.</p>
<p><a id="Page_176" class="pageno" title="[176]"/>(e). Garlands made of the above flowers, when worn by the woman, produce the same effect.</p>
<p>(f). An ointment made of the fruit of the asteracantha longifolia (kokilaksha) will contract the yoni of a Hastini or elephant woman, and this contraction lasts for one night.</p>
<p>(g). An ointment made by pounding the roots of the nelumbrium speciosum, and of the blue lotus, and the powder of the plant physalis flexuosa mixed with ghee and honey, will enlarge the yoni of the Mrigi or deer woman.</p>
<p>(h). An ointment made of the fruit of the emblica myrabolans soaked in the milky juice of the milk hedge plant, of the soma plant, the calotropis gigantea, and the juice of the fruit of the vernonia anthelmintica, will make the hair white.</p>
<p>(i). The juice of the roots of the madayantaka plant, the yellow amaranth, the anjanika plant, the clitoria ternateea, and the shlakshnaparni plant, used as a lotion, will make the hair grow.</p>
<p>(j). An ointment made by boiling the above roots in oil, and rubbed in, will make the hair black, and will also gradually restore hair that has fallen off.</p>
<p>(k) If lac is saturated seven times in the sweat of the testicle of a white horse, and applied to a red lip, the lip will become white.</p>
<p>(l). The colour of the lips can be regained by means of the madayantika and other plants mentioned above under (i).</p>
<p>(m). A woman who hears a man playing on a reed pipe which has been dressed with the juices of the bahupadika plant, the tabernamontana coronaria, the costus speciosus or arabicus, the pinus deodora, the euphorbia antiquorum, the vajra and the kantaka plant, becomes his slave.</p>
<p>(n). If food be mixed with the fruit of the thorn apple (Dathura) it causes intoxication.</p>
<p>(o). If water be mixed with oil and the ashes of any kind of grass except the kusha grass, it becomes the colour of milk.</p>
<p>(p). If yellow myrabolans, the hog plum, the shrawana plant, and the priyangu plant be all pounded together, and applied to iron pots, these pots become red.</p>
<p>(q). If a lamp, trimmed with oil extracted from the shrawana and priyangn plants, its wick being made of cloth and the slough<a id="Page_177" class="pageno" title="[177]"/> of the skins of snakes, is lighted, and long pieces of wood placed near it, those pieces of wood will resemble so many snakes.</p>
<p>(r). Drinking the milk of a white cow who has a white calf at her feet is auspicious, produces fame, and preserves life.</p>
<p>(s). The blessings of venerable Brahmans, well propitiated, have the same effect.</p>
<p>There are also some verses in conclusion:</p>
<p>"Thus have I written in a few words the 'Science of love,' after reading the texts of ancient authors, and following the ways of enjoyment mentioned in them."</p>
<p>"He who is acquainted with the true principles of this science pays regard to Dharma, Artha, Kama, and to his own experiences, as well as to the teachings of others, and does not act simply on the dictates of his own desire. As for the errors in the science of love which I have mentioned in this work, on my own authority as an author, I have, immediately after mentioning them, carefully censured and prohibited them."</p>
<p>"An act is never looked upon with indulgence for the simple reason that it is authorised by the science, because it ought to be remembered that it is the intention of the science, that the rules which it contains should only be acted upon in particular cases. After reading and considering the works of Babhravya and other ancient authors, and thinking over the meaning of the rules given by them, the Kama Sutra was composed, according to the precepts of Holy Writ, for the benefit of the world, by Vatsyayana, while leading the life of a religious student, and wholly engaged in the contemplation of the Deity."</p>
<p>"This work is not intended to be used merely as an instrument for satisfying our desires. A person, acquainted with the true principles of this science, and who preserves his Dharma, Artha, and Kama, and has regard for the practices of the people, is sure to obtain the mastery over his senses."</p>
<p>"In short, an intelligent and prudent person, attending to Dharma and Artha, and attending to Kama also, without becoming the slave of his passions, obtains success in everything that he may undertake."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00090"><a id="CONCLUDING_REMARKS"/>CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h2>
<p>Thus ends, in seven parts, the Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana, which might otherwise be called a treatise on men and women, their mutual relationship, and connection with each other.</p>
<p>It is a work that should be studied by all, both old and young; the former will find in it real truths, gathered by experience, and already tested by themselves, while the latter will derive the great advantage of learning things, which some perhaps may otherwise never learn at all, or which they may only learn when it is too late ("too late" those immortal words of Mirabeau) to profit by the learning.</p>
<p>It can also be fairly commended to the student of social science and of humanity, and above all to the student of those early ideas, which have gradually filtered down through the sands of time, and which seem to prove that the human nature of to-day is much the same as the human nature of the long ago.</p>
<p>It has been said of Balzac [the great, if not the greatest of French novelists] that he seemed to have inherited a natural and intuitive perception of the feelings of men and women, and has described them with an analysis worthy of a man of science. The author of the present work must also have had a considerable knowledge of the humanities. Many of his remarks are so full of simplicity and truth, that they have stood the test of time, and stand out still as clear and true as when they were first written, some eighteen hundred years ago.</p>
<p>As a collection of facts, told in plain and simple language, it must be remembered that in those early days there was apparently no idea of embellishing the work, either with a<a id="Page_179" class="pageno" title="[179]"/> literary style, a flow of language, or a quantity of superfluous padding. The author tells the world what he knows in very concise language, without any attempt to produce an interesting story. From his facts how many novels could be written! Indeed much of the matter contained in parts <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-2.htm.html#PART_III" class="pginternal"><span class="lowercase smcap">III</span></a>. <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-2.htm.html#PART_IV" class="pginternal"><span class="lowercase smcap">IV</span></a>. <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-3.htm.html#PART_V" class="pginternal"><span class="lowercase smcap">V</span></a>. and <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-4.htm.html#PART_VI" class="pginternal"><span class="lowercase smcap">VI</span></a>., has formed the basis of many of the stories and the tales of past centuries.</p>
<p>There will be found in part <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-4.htm.html#PART_VII" class="pginternal"><span class="lowercase smcap">VII</span></a>., some curious recipes. Many of them appear to be as primitive as the book itself, but in later works of the same nature these recipes and prescriptions appear to have increased, both as regards quality and quantity. In the Anunga Runga or "The Stage of Love," mentioned at page <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-0.htm.html#Page_5" class="pginternal">5</a> of the Preface in Part <span class="lowercase smcap">I.</span>, there are found no less than thirty-three different subjects for which one hundred and thirty recipes and prescriptions are given.</p>
<p>As the details may be interesting, these subjects are described as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>For hastening the paroxysm of the woman.</li>
<li>For delaying the organs of the man.</li>
<li>Aphrodisiacs.</li>
<li>For thickening and enlarging the lingam, rendering it sound and strong, hard and lusty.</li>
<li>For narrowing and contracting the yoni.</li>
<li>For perfuming the yoni.</li>
<li>For removing and destroying the hair of the body.</li>
<li>For removing the sudden stopping of the monthly ailment.</li>
<li>For abating the immoderate appearance of the monthly ailment.</li>
<li>For purifying the womb.</li>
<li>For causing pregnancy.</li>
<li>For preventing miscarriage and other accidents.</li>
<li>For ensuring easy labour and ready <a id="corr45"/><a class="correction pginternal" href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-6.htm.html#cn45" title="changed from 'deliverence'">deliverance</a>.</li>
<li>For limiting the number of children.</li>
<li>For thickening and beautifying the hair.</li>
<li>For obtaining a good black colour to it.</li>
<li>For whitening and bleaching it.</li>
<li>For renewing it.</li>
<li><a id="Page_180" class="pageno" title="[180]"/>For clearing the skin of the face from eruptions that break out and leave black spots upon it.</li>
<li>For removing the black colour of the epidermis.</li>
<li>For enlarging the breasts of women.</li>
<li>For raising and hardening pendulous breasts.</li>
<li>For giving a fragrance to the skin.</li>
<li>For removing the evil savour of perspiration.</li>
<li>For anointing the body after bathing.</li>
<li>For causing a pleasant smell to the breath.</li>
<li>Drugs and charms for the purposes of fascinating, overcoming, and subduing either men or women.</li>
<li>Recipes for enabling a woman to attract and preserve her husband's love.</li>
<li>Magical collyriums for winning love and friendship.</li>
<li>Prescriptions for reducing other persons to submission.</li>
<li>Philter pills, and other charms.</li>
<li>Fascinating incense, or fumigation.</li>
<li>Magical verses which have the power of fascination.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of the one hundred and thirty recipes given, many of them are absurd, but not more perhaps than many of the recipes and prescriptions in use in Europe not so very long ago. Love-philters, charms, and herbal remedies have been, in early days, as freely used in Europe as in Asia, and doubtless some people believe in them still in many places.</p>
<p>And now, one word about the author of the work, the good old sage Vatsyayana. It is much to be regretted that nothing can be discovered about his life, his belongings, and his surroundings. At the end of Part <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@27827@27827-h@27827-h-4.htm.html#PART_VII" class="pginternal"><span class="lowercase smcap">VII</span></a>. he states that he wrote the work while leading the life of a religious student [probably at Benares] and while wholly engaged in the contemplation of the Deity. He must have arrived at a certain age at that time, for throughout he gives us the benefit of his experience, and of his opinions, and these bear the stamp of age rather than of youth; indeed the work could hardly have been written by a young man.</p>
<p>In a beautiful verse of the Vedas of the Christians it has been said of the peaceful dead, that they rest from their labours, and that their works do follow them. Yes indeed, the works of men of genius do follow them, and remain as a<a id="Page_181" class="pageno" title="[181]"/> lasting treasure. And though there may be disputes and discussions about the immortality of the body or the soul, nobody can deny the immortality of genius, which ever remains as a bright and guiding star to the struggling humanities of succeeding ages. This work, then, which has stood the test of centuries, has placed Vatsyayana among the immortals, and on This, and on Him no better elegy or eulogy can be written than the following lines:</p>
<p><span class="c12">"So long as lips shall kiss, and eyes shall see,</span><br/>
<span class="c12">So long lives This, and This gives life to Thee."</span><br/></p>

The subject is dealt with at some length in H. H. Wilson's 'Select Specimens of the Theatre of the Hindoos,' in two volumes, Trubner &amp; Co., 1871. It may be fairly considered that the courtesan was one of the elements, and an important element too, of early Hindoo society, and that her education and intellect were both superior to that of the women of the household. Wilson says, "By the Vesya or courtesan, however, we are not to understand a female who has disregarded the obligation of law or the precepts of virtue, but a character reared by a state of manners unfriendly to the admission of wedded females into society, and opening it only at the expense of reputation to women who were trained for association with men by personal and mental acquirements to which the matron was a stranger."</p>

From these sculptures being found in such places, it would seem that this practice was popular in that part of the country at that time.
